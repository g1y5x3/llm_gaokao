"A certain basketball shooting competition is divided into two stages, with each participating team consisting of two members. The specific rules of the competition are as follows: In the first stage, one member of the participating team shoots 3 times. If all 3 shots miss, the team is eliminated and their competition score is 0 points. If at least one shot is made, the team enters the second stage, where the other team member shoots 3 times. Each successful shot in the second stage scores 5 points, while a miss scores 0 points. The team's competition score is the sum of points from the second stage.
