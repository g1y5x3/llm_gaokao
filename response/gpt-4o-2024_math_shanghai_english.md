Prompt: Given the universal set $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and set $A=\{2,4\}$, find $\bar{A}$?

Response:

To find the complement of set \( A \) (denoted as \(\bar{A}\)) with respect to the universal set \( U \), we need to determine the elements that are in \( U \) but not in \( A \).

Given:
- Universal set \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)
- Set \( A = \{2, 4\} \)

The complement of \( A \), \(\bar{A}\), consists of all elements in \( U \) that are not in \( A \).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. List all elements in the universal set \( U \):
   \[
   U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
   \]

2. List all elements in set \( A \):
   \[
   A = \{2, 4\}
   \]

3. Identify the elements in \( U \) that are not in \( A \):
   - The elements in \( U \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \).
   - The elements in \( A \) are \( 2, 4 \).
   - The elements in \( U \) that are not in \( A \) are \( 1, 3, 5 \).

Therefore, the complement of \( A \) is:
\[
\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\{1, 3, 5\}}
\]

Answer:$\{1,3,5\}$

#### 2
Prompt: Given $f(x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{x}, x > 0 \\1, x \leq 0\end{cases}$, what is $f(3)$?

Response:

To determine the value of \( f(3) \) for the given piecewise function \( f(x) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the correct piece of the function to use**:
   The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
   \[
   f(x) = \begin{cases}
   \sqrt{x}, & \text{if } x > 0 \\
   1, & \text{if } x \leq 0
   \end{cases}
   \]
   We need to determine which condition applies to \( x = 3 \).

2. **Check the condition for \( x = 3 \)**:
   Since \( 3 > 0 \), we use the first piece of the function, which is \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \).

3. **Calculate \( f(3) \)**:
   Using the first piece of the function, we substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( \sqrt{x} \):
   \[
   f(3) = \sqrt{3}
   \]

Thus, the value of \( f(3) \) is \( \sqrt{3} \). Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Answer:$\sqrt{3}$

#### 3
Prompt: Given $x \in R$, what is the solution set for $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$?

Response:

To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the roots of the corresponding equation \( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \)**:
   - This is a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
   - We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).

   Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = -3 \).

   \[
   x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]

   Simplify inside the square root:

   \[
   x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{2 \pm 4}{2}
   \]

   This gives us two solutions:

   \[
   x = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2 - 4}{2} = -1
   \]

2. **Determine the intervals to test**:
   - The roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

3. **Test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 \) holds**:
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 2(-2) - 3 = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5 \quad (\text{positive})
     \]
   - For \( x \in (-1, 3) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     0^2 - 2(0) - 3 = -3 \quad (\text{negative})
     \]
   - For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     4^2 - 2(4) - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5 \quad (\text{positive})
     \]

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 \) holds in the interval where the test point resulted in a negative value.
   - This occurs in the interval \( (-1, 3) \).

Therefore, the solution set for the inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 \) is:

\[
\boxed{(-1, 3)}
\]

Answer:$(-1,3)$

#### 4
Prompt: Given $F(x) = x^3 + a$, and $F(x)$ is an odd function, $x \in R$, what is $a$?

Response:

To determine the value of \( a \) such that \( F(x) = x^3 + a \) is an odd function, we need to use the definition of an odd function. A function \( F(x) \) is odd if it satisfies the condition:

\[
F(-x) = -F(x) \quad \text{for all} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Given \( F(x) = x^3 + a \), we first compute \( F(-x) \):

\[
F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a = -x^3 + a
\]

Next, we use the condition for \( F(x) \) to be an odd function:

\[
F(-x) = -F(x)
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( F(-x) \) and \( F(x) \):

\[
-x^3 + a = -(x^3 + a)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
-x^3 + a = -x^3 - a
\]

Now, we equate the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation. The \( -x^3 \) terms are already equal, so we focus on the constant terms:

\[
a = -a
\]

To solve for \( a \), we add \( a \) to both sides of the equation:

\[
a + a = 0
\]

\[
2a = 0
\]

\[
a = 0
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) that makes \( F(x) = x^3 + a \) an odd function is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

Answer:$0$

#### 5
Prompt: Given $k \in R$, $\vec{a}=(2,5)$, $\vec{b}=(6,k)$, and $\vec{a}//\vec{b}$, what is the value of $k$?

Response:

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the vectors \(\vec{a} = (2, 5)\) and \(\vec{b} = (6, k)\) are parallel, we need to use the property that two vectors are parallel if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other. This means there exists a scalar \( \lambda \) such that:

\[
\vec{b} = \lambda \vec{a}
\]

Given \(\vec{a} = (2, 5)\) and \(\vec{b} = (6, k)\), we can write:

\[
(6, k) = \lambda (2, 5)
\]

This gives us two equations by comparing the components:

\[
6 = 2\lambda
\]
\[
k = 5\lambda
\]

First, solve for \(\lambda\) using the first equation:

\[
6 = 2\lambda \implies \lambda = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, substitute \(\lambda = 3\) into the second equation to find \( k \):

\[
k = 5\lambda = 5 \times 3 = 15
\]

Thus, the value of \( k \) is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Answer:$15$

#### 6
Prompt: In the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$, if the sum of all coefficients is 32, what is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term?

Response:

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the binomial expansion of \((x+1)^n\). The general form of the binomial expansion is:

\[
(x+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^k
\]

The sum of all coefficients in the expansion is obtained by setting \(x = 1\):

\[
(1+1)^n = 2^n
\]

We are given that the sum of all coefficients is 32:

\[
2^n = 32
\]

Solving for \(n\), we recognize that \(32\) is a power of \(2\):

\[
32 = 2^5
\]

Thus,

\[
n = 5
\]

Next, we need to find the coefficient of the \(x^2\) term in the expansion of \((x+1)^5\). The coefficient of \(x^k\) in the expansion of \((x+1)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}\). For \(k = 2\) and \(n = 5\), the coefficient is:

\[
\binom{5}{2}
\]

We calculate \(\binom{5}{2}\) as follows:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2 \times 1 \times 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Therefore, the coefficient of the \(x^2\) term is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Answer:$10$

#### 7
Prompt: Given a point $P$ on the parabola $y^2=4x$, and the distance from $P$ to the directrix is 9, what is the distance from $P$ to the x-axis?

Response:

Given a point \( P \) on the parabola \( y^2 = 4x \), we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the \( x \)-axis, given that the distance from \( P \) to the directrix is 9.

First, recall the properties of the parabola \( y^2 = 4x \):
- The vertex is at \( (0, 0) \).
- The focus is at \( (1, 0) \).
- The directrix is the line \( x = -1 \).

Let \( P = (x_1, y_1) \) be a point on the parabola. Since \( P \) lies on the parabola, it satisfies the equation \( y_1^2 = 4x_1 \).

The distance from \( P \) to the directrix \( x = -1 \) is given by:
\[
d = |x_1 - (-1)| = |x_1 + 1|
\]
We are given that this distance is 9:
\[
|x_1 + 1| = 9
\]
This gives us two possible equations:
\[
x_1 + 1 = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x_1 + 1 = -9
\]
Solving these, we get:
\[
x_1 = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x_1 = -10
\]

Next, we use the equation of the parabola \( y_1^2 = 4x_1 \) to find \( y_1 \) for each \( x_1 \).

1. For \( x_1 = 8 \):
\[
y_1^2 = 4 \cdot 8 = 32 \implies y_1 = \pm \sqrt{32} = \pm 4\sqrt{2}
\]

2. For \( x_1 = -10 \):
\[
y_1^2 = 4 \cdot (-10) = -40
\]
This is not possible since \( y_1^2 \) cannot be negative. Therefore, \( x_1 = -10 \) is not a valid solution.

Thus, the only valid point \( P \) is \( (8, 4\sqrt{2}) \) or \( (8, -4\sqrt{2}) \).

The distance from \( P \) to the \( x \)-axis is the absolute value of the \( y \)-coordinate:
\[
|y_1| = |4\sqrt{2}| = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the \( x \)-axis is \(\boxed{4\sqrt{2}}\).

Answer:$4\sqrt{2}$

#### 8
Prompt: A school is holding a science competition with three question banks: A, B, and C. Question bank A has 5000 questions, B has 4000 questions, and C has 3000 questions. Xiao Shen has completed all the questions. His accuracy rate for question bank A is 0.92, for B is 0.86, and for C is 0.72. Now, if he randomly selects a question from all the questions, what is the probability of answering it correctly?

Response:

To determine the probability that Xiao Shen answers a randomly selected question correctly, we need to consider the total number of questions and the number of questions he answers correctly from each question bank.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions:
\[
5000 + 4000 + 3000 = 12000
\]

Next, we calculate the number of questions Xiao Shen answers correctly from each question bank:
- For question bank A:
\[
0.92 \times 5000 = 4600
\]
- For question bank B:
\[
0.86 \times 4000 = 3440
\]
- For question bank C:
\[
0.72 \times 3000 = 2160
\]

Now, we sum the number of questions he answers correctly from all question banks:
\[
4600 + 3440 + 2160 = 10200
\]

The probability that Xiao Shen answers a randomly selected question correctly is the ratio of the total number of questions he answers correctly to the total number of questions:
\[
\frac{10200}{12000}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 600:
\[
\frac{10200 \div 600}{12000 \div 600} = \frac{17}{20}
\]

Thus, the probability that Xiao Shen answers a randomly selected question correctly is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{17}{20}}
\]

Answer:$\frac{17}{20}$

#### 9
Prompt: Given a complex number $z$ with real part 1, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=m(m \in R)$, what is the real number $m$?

Response:

Given a complex number \( z \) with real part 1, and the equation \( z + \frac{2}{z} = m \) where \( m \) is a real number, we need to determine the value of \( m \).

First, let \( z = 1 + yi \) where \( y \) is a real number and \( i \) is the imaginary unit. Then, we have:
\[
z = 1 + yi
\]

Next, we need to find \( \frac{2}{z} \). To do this, we first find the reciprocal of \( z \):
\[
\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{1 + yi}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{1}{1 + yi} \), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + yi} \cdot \frac{1 - yi}{1 - yi} = \frac{1 - yi}{(1 + yi)(1 - yi)} = \frac{1 - yi}{1 + y^2}
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 - yi}{1 + y^2}
\]

Now, we multiply by 2:
\[
\frac{2}{z} = \frac{2(1 - yi)}{1 + y^2} = \frac{2 - 2yi}{1 + y^2}
\]

Next, we add \( z \) and \( \frac{2}{z} \):
\[
z + \frac{2}{z} = (1 + yi) + \frac{2 - 2yi}{1 + y^2}
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:
\[
z + \frac{2}{z} = 1 + yi + \frac{2}{1 + y^2} - \frac{2yi}{1 + y^2}
\]

Separate the real and imaginary parts:
\[
z + \frac{2}{z} = \left(1 + \frac{2}{1 + y^2}\right) + \left(y - \frac{2y}{1 + y^2}\right)i
\]

Since \( m \) is a real number, the imaginary part must be zero:
\[
y - \frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = 0
\]

Factor out \( y \):
\[
y \left(1 - \frac{2}{1 + y^2}\right) = 0
\]

This gives us two cases:
1. \( y = 0 \)
2. \( 1 - \frac{2}{1 + y^2} = 0 \)

For the second case:
\[
1 - \frac{2}{1 + y^2} = 0 \implies \frac{2}{1 + y^2} = 1 \implies 2 = 1 + y^2 \implies y^2 = 1 \implies y = \pm 1
\]

Now, we consider the real part for each \( y \):
1. If \( y = 0 \):
\[
z = 1 \implies z + \frac{2}{z} = 1 + \frac{2}{1} = 1 + 2 = 3
\]

2. If \( y = 1 \):
\[
z = 1 + i \implies \frac{2}{z} = \frac{2}{1 + i} = \frac{2(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)} = \frac{2(1 - i)}{1 + 1} = \frac{2 - 2i}{2} = 1 - i
\]
\[
z + \frac{2}{z} = (1 + i) + (1 - i) = 2
\]

3. If \( y = -1 \):
\[
z = 1 - i \implies \frac{2}{z} = \frac{2}{1 - i} = \frac{2(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{2(1 + i)}{1 + 1} = \frac{2 + 2i}{2} = 1 + i
\]
\[
z + \frac{2}{z} = (1 - i) + (1 + i) = 2
\]

Thus, the possible values of \( m \) are 3 and 2. However, since the problem asks for a single real number \( m \), we need to verify the conditions. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the consistent solution is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

Answer:$2$

#### 10
Prompt: Let the elements in set $A$ be three-digit positive integers without repeated digits, and the product of any two elements in the set is always even. What is the maximum number of elements that can be in this set?

Response:

To determine the maximum number of elements in set \( A \) such that each element is a three-digit positive integer without repeated digits and the product of any two elements is always even, we need to analyze the properties of the numbers involved.

First, consider the condition that the product of any two elements in the set must be even. This implies that at least one of the two numbers in any pair must be even. Therefore, if any number in the set is odd, it must be paired with an even number to ensure the product is even. 

To maximize the number of elements in the set, we need to consider the properties of three-digit numbers:
- A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999.
- A number is even if its last digit is one of \( \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\} \).
- A number is odd if its last digit is one of \( \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\} \).

Given that the product of any two elements must be even, we can infer that all numbers in the set must be even. If any number were odd, it would require pairing with an even number, which would limit the set size due to the need for even numbers to pair with all odd numbers.

Next, we need to count the number of valid three-digit even numbers without repeated digits:
1. The hundreds place can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
2. The tens place can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the digit in the hundreds place (9 choices).
3. The units place must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and different from the hundreds and tens places.

Let's count the valid combinations:
- For the hundreds place, we have 9 choices.
- For the tens place, we have 9 choices (excluding the digit used in the hundreds place).
- For the units place, we have 5 choices (even digits) minus any digits already used in the hundreds or tens places.

To maximize the number of elements, we need to ensure that the units place is always an even digit. We can calculate the number of valid three-digit even numbers without repeated digits as follows:
- Choose the hundreds place: 9 options.
- Choose the tens place: 9 options.
- Choose the units place: 5 options (even digits).

However, we must adjust for the fact that the units place must be different from the other two digits. This adjustment is straightforward since the units place has 5 options, and the tens place has 8 options (excluding the digit in the hundreds place and ensuring no repetition).

Thus, the total number of valid three-digit even numbers without repeated digits is:
\[
9 \times 9 \times 5 = 405
\]

Therefore, the maximum number of elements in set \( A \) is \(\boxed{405}\).

Answer:$329$

#### 11
Prompt: Given that $A$ is due east of $O$, $B$ is due north of $O$, the distances from $O$ to $A$ and $B$ are equal, angle $BTO=16.5^\circ$, angle $ATO=37^\circ$, what is angle $BOT=$ (to the nearest 0.1 degree)?

Response:

Given the points \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( A \) is due east of \( O \) and \( B \) is due north of \( O \), and the distances from \( O \) to \( A \) and \( B \) are equal, we need to find the angle \( \angle BOT \) given that \( \angle BTO = 16.5^\circ \) and \( \angle ATO = 37^\circ \).

First, let's establish the coordinates of the points:
- \( O \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- \( A \) is at \((a, 0)\) since it is due east of \( O \).
- \( B \) is at \((0, a)\) since it is due north of \( O \).

We are given:
- \( \angle BTO = 16.5^\circ \)
- \( \angle ATO = 37^\circ \)

We need to find \( \angle BOT \).

Since \( A \) is due east and \( B \) is due north, \( \angle AOB = 90^\circ \).

Now, consider the triangle \( AOT \):
- \( \angle ATO = 37^\circ \)
- \( \angle OAT = 90^\circ - \angle ATO = 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 53^\circ \)

Next, consider the triangle \( BOT \):
- \( \angle BTO = 16.5^\circ \)
- \( \angle OBT = 90^\circ - \angle BTO = 90^\circ - 16.5^\circ = 73.5^\circ \)

Since \( \angle AOB = 90^\circ \), we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
\[ \angle AOB + \angle BOT + \angle AOT = 360^\circ \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 90^\circ + \angle BOT + 37^\circ + 16.5^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 90^\circ + \angle BOT + 53.5^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 143.5^\circ + \angle BOT = 360^\circ \]

Solve for \( \angle BOT \):
\[ \angle BOT = 360^\circ - 143.5^\circ = 216.5^\circ \]

However, this angle is not within the typical range for an angle in a triangle. We need to consider the correct interpretation of the angles in the context of the problem. The correct approach is to recognize that \( \angle BOT \) is the angle between the lines \( OB \) and \( OT \), which is the same as the angle between the lines \( OA \) and \( OT \) minus the angle \( \angle AOB \).

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
\[ \angle BOT = 90^\circ - (37^\circ - 16.5^\circ) = 90^\circ - 20.5^\circ = 69.5^\circ \]

Therefore, the correct angle \( \angle BOT \) is:
\[ \boxed{69.5^\circ} \]

Answer:$7.8^\circ$

#### 12
Prompt: For a geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ with first term $a_1>0$ and common ratio $q>1$, let $I_n=\{x-y|x,y\in[a_1,a_2]\cup[a_n,a_{n+1}]\}$. If $I_n$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$, what is the range of $q$?

Response:

Given a geometric sequence \(\{a_n\}\) with first term \(a_1 > 0\) and common ratio \(q > 1\), we need to determine the range of \(q\) such that \(I_n = \{x - y \mid x, y \in [a_1, a_2] \cup [a_n, a_{n+1}]\}\) forms a closed interval for any positive integer \(n\).

First, we express the terms of the sequence:
\[
a_1 = a_1, \quad a_2 = a_1 q, \quad a_n = a_1 q^{n-1}, \quad a_{n+1} = a_1 q^n
\]

The interval \(I_n\) is formed by the differences \(x - y\) where \(x, y\) are chosen from \([a_1, a_2] \cup [a_n, a_{n+1}]\). We need to consider all possible differences:
\[
x - y \quad \text{where} \quad x, y \in \{a_1, a_1 q, a_1 q^{n-1}, a_1 q^n\}
\]

We calculate the differences:
\[
\begin{aligned}
a_1 - a_1 &= 0, \\
a_1 q - a_1 &= a_1 (q - 1), \\
a_1 q^{n-1} - a_1 &= a_1 (q^{n-1} - 1), \\
a_1 q^n - a_1 &= a_1 (q^n - 1), \\
a_1 q - a_1 q^{n-1} &= a_1 (q - q^{n-1}), \\
a_1 q - a_1 q^n &= a_1 (q - q^n), \\
a_1 q^{n-1} - a_1 q &= a_1 (q^{n-1} - q), \\
a_1 q^n - a_1 q &= a_1 (q^n - q), \\
a_1 q^{n-1} - a_1 q^n &= a_1 (q^{n-1} - q^n), \\
a_1 q^n - a_1 q^{n-1} &= a_1 (q^n - q^{n-1}).
\end{aligned}
\]

The smallest and largest differences are:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min &= a_1 (q - q^n), \\
\max &= a_1 (q^n - 1).
\end{aligned}
\]

For \(I_n\) to be a closed interval, the set of differences must cover all values between the minimum and maximum differences. This requires that the interval \([a_1 (q - q^n), a_1 (q^n - 1)]\) be continuous and cover all intermediate values.

To ensure this, the differences must span all values between the smallest and largest differences. This is possible if and only if:
\[
q - q^n \leq q^{n-1} - 1
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
q - q^n \leq q^{n-1} - 1 \implies q - q^n \leq q^{n-1} - 1
\]

For large \(n\), the dominant term is \(q^n\), and the inequality simplifies to:
\[
q - q^n \leq q^{n-1} - 1
\]

This inequality holds for all \(n\) if \(q\) is such that the differences span the entire interval. The critical value for \(q\) is when \(q = 2\), as for \(q > 2\), the differences do not span the entire interval.

Thus, the range of \(q\) is:
\[

Prompt: Given that air temperature and sea surface temperature are correlated, and the correlation coefficient is positive, which of the following descriptions is correct?
A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high
B. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low
C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend
D. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend

Response:

To determine the correct description based on the given information, we need to understand the implications of a positive correlation coefficient between air temperature and sea surface temperature.

1. **Understanding Correlation Coefficient**:
   - A correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
   - A positive correlation coefficient indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase.

2. **Given Information**:
   - Air temperature and sea surface temperature are correlated.
   - The correlation coefficient is positive.

3. **Implications of Positive Correlation**:
   - Since the correlation coefficient is positive, it means that there is a direct relationship between air temperature and sea surface temperature.
   - Specifically, when air temperature increases, sea surface temperature also tends to increase.

4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option A**: "When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high."
     - This is consistent with a positive correlation because high air temperature would be associated with high sea surface temperature.
   - **Option B**: "When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low."
     - This is inconsistent with a positive correlation because it suggests an inverse relationship.
   - **Option C**: "As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend."
     - This is consistent with a positive correlation because it describes an increasing trend in sea surface temperature as air temperature increases.
   - **Option D**: "As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend."
     - This is inconsistent with a positive correlation because it suggests a decreasing trend.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Both Option A and Option C correctly describe the relationship implied by a positive correlation coefficient.
   - However, Option C provides a more detailed description of the trend over a range of values.

Therefore, the correct description is:
\[
\boxed{\text{C}}
\]

Answer:C

#### 14
Prompt: Which of the following functions $f(x)$ has a minimum positive period of $2\pi$?
A. $\sin x + \cos x$
B. $\sin x \cos x$
C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$
D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

Response:

To determine which function \( f(x) \) has a minimum positive period of \( 2\pi \), we need to analyze the periodicity of each function given in the options.

**Option A: \( \sin x + \cos x \)**

First, we recall the periods of the sine and cosine functions:
- The period of \( \sin x \) is \( 2\pi \).
- The period of \( \cos x \) is \( 2\pi \).

The sum of two functions with the same period \( 2\pi \) will also have a period of \( 2\pi \). Therefore, the function \( \sin x + \cos x \) has a period of \( 2\pi \).

**Option B: \( \sin x \cos x \)**

We use the product-to-sum identities to rewrite \( \sin x \cos x \):
\[
\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(2x))
\]
The period of \( \sin(2x) \) is \( \pi \) because the argument \( 2x \) completes one full cycle when \( x \) goes from \( 0 \) to \( \pi \). Therefore, the period of \( \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x) \) is also \( \pi \).

**Option C: \( \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x \)**

We use the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1
\]
This is a constant function, and a constant function does not have a period in the usual sense because it does not vary with \( x \). However, if we consider it as having a period, it would be any positive number, including \( 2\pi \).

**Option D: \( \sin^2 x - \cos^2 x \)**

We use the double-angle identities:
\[
\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}, \quad \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2}
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} - \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} = -\cos(2x)
\]
The period of \( \cos(2x) \) is \( \pi \), so the period of \( -\cos(2x) \) is also \( \pi \).

**Conclusion:**

- Option A: \( \sin x + \cos x \) has a period of \( 2\pi \).
- Option B: \( \sin x \cos x \) has a period of \( \pi \).
- Option C: \( \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x \) is a constant function.
- Option D: \( \sin^2 x - \cos^2 x \) has a period of \( \pi \).

The function with a minimum positive period of \( 2\pi \) is \( \sin x + \cos x \).

Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{A}}\).

Answer:A

#### 15
Prompt: Define a set $\Omega$, whose elements are sets of points in space. For any $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist real numbers $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$, not all zero, such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$. Given that $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, what is the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not \in \Omega$?
A. $(0,0,0)$
B. $(-1,0,0)$
C. $(0,1,0)$
D. $(0,0,-1)$

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to understand the condition given for the set \(\Omega\). Specifically, for any three points \(P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega\), there exist real numbers \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3\), not all zero, such that:

\[
\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0
\]

This implies that any three points in \(\Omega\) are linearly dependent. In other words, the vectors corresponding to these points must lie in the same plane through the origin.

Given that \((1,0,0) \in \Omega\), we need to determine the sufficient condition for \((0,0,1) \not\in \Omega\).

Let's analyze each option:

**Option A: \((0,0,0)\)**

The point \((0,0,0)\) is the origin. Including the origin in \(\Omega\) does not affect the linear dependence condition because any vector is linearly dependent with the zero vector. Therefore, this option does not provide any information about excluding \((0,0,1)\) from \(\Omega\).

**Option B: \((-1,0,0)\)**

If \((-1,0,0) \in \Omega\), then we have two points \((1,0,0)\) and \((-1,0,0)\) in \(\Omega\). These two points are linearly dependent because:

\[
1 \cdot (1,0,0) + (-1) \cdot (-1,0,0) = (1,0,0) + (1,0,0) = (2,0,0) \neq 0
\]

This does not help in determining the exclusion of \((0,0,1)\).

**Option C: \((0,1,0)\)**

If \((0,1,0) \in \Omega\), then we have two points \((1,0,0)\) and \((0,1,0)\) in \(\Omega\). These two points are linearly independent. To satisfy the condition, any third point in \(\Omega\) must be a linear combination of these two points. Therefore, any point in \(\Omega\) must lie in the plane spanned by \((1,0,0)\) and \((0,1,0)\). The point \((0,0,1)\) does not lie in this plane, so \((0,0,1) \not\in \Omega\).

**Option D: \((0,0,-1)\)**

If \((0,0,-1) \in \Omega\), then we have two points \((1,0,0)\) and \((0,0,-1)\) in \(\Omega\). These two points are linearly independent. To satisfy the condition, any third point in \(\Omega\) must be a linear combination of these two points. Therefore, any point in \(\Omega\) must lie in the plane spanned by \((1,0,0)\) and \((0,0,-1)\). The point \((0,0,1)\) does not lie in this plane, so \((0,0,1) \not\in \Omega\).

Both options C and D provide sufficient conditions for \((0,0,1) \not\in \Omega\). However, the problem asks for a single sufficient condition, and typically, we would choose the simplest or most direct one.

Thus, the sufficient condition for \((0,0,1) \not\in \Omega\) is:

\[
\boxed{(0,1,0)}
\]

Answer:C

#### 16
Prompt: Define the set $M=\{x_0|x_0 \in R, X \in (-\infty, X_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$. Among all $f(x)$ that make $M=[-1,1]$, which of the following is true?
A. $f(x)$ is an even function
B. $f(x)$ reaches its maximum at $x=2$
C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing
D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the set \( M \) and determine the properties of the function \( f(x) \) that make \( M = [-1, 1] \).

Given:
\[ M = \{x_0 \mid x_0 \in \mathbb{R}, x \in (-\infty, x_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\} \]

We are told that \( M = [-1, 1] \). This means that for any \( x_0 \in [-1, 1] \), the function \( f(x) \) must satisfy:
\[ f(x) < f(x_0) \text{ for all } x \in (-\infty, x_0) \]

This implies that \( f(x) \) must be increasing on the interval \((-\infty, -1)\) and \((-\infty, 1)\). Additionally, \( f(x) \) must reach a local maximum at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \), because for \( x_0 \) in \([-1, 1]\), \( f(x) \) must be less than \( f(x_0) \) for all \( x < x_0 \).

Let's analyze each option:

A. \( f(x) \) is an even function.
   - An even function satisfies \( f(x) = f(-x) \). This property is not necessarily implied by the given condition \( M = [-1, 1] \). Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

B. \( f(x) \) reaches its maximum at \( x = 2 \).
   - The set \( M \) does not provide any information about the behavior of \( f(x) \) at \( x = 2 \). Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

C. \( f(x) \) is strictly increasing.
   - If \( f(x) \) were strictly increasing, then \( M \) would be the entire real line, not just \([-1, 1]\). Therefore, this option is not true.

D. \( f(x) \) reaches a local minimum at \( x = -1 \).
   - For \( M = [-1, 1] \), \( f(x) \) must reach a local maximum at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \), not a local minimum. Therefore, this option is not true.

Since none of the options A, B, C, or D are true based on the given set \( M = [-1, 1] \), the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{\text{None of the above}}\)

Answer:D

#### 17
Prompt: As shown in the figure, P-ABCD is a regular square pyramid, and O is the center of the base ABCD.
(1) If $AP = 5$, $AD=3√2$, find the volume of the geometric body formed by rotating $\triangle POA$ around PO for one complete revolution?
(2) If $AP=AD$, E is the midpoint of PB, find the angle between line BD and plane AEC?

Response:

Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### Part (1)
Given:
- \( AP = 5 \)
- \( AD = 3\sqrt{2} \)

First, we need to find the side length of the square base \( ABCD \). Since \( AD \) is the diagonal of the square base, we can use the relationship between the side length \( a \) and the diagonal of a square:
\[ AD = a\sqrt{2} \]
Given \( AD = 3\sqrt{2} \):
\[ 3\sqrt{2} = a\sqrt{2} \]
\[ a = 3 \]

Next, we need to find the height \( PO \) of the pyramid. Since \( O \) is the center of the square base, the distance from \( A \) to \( O \) (half the diagonal of the square) is:
\[ AO = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle POA \):
\[ AP^2 = PO^2 + AO^2 \]
\[ 5^2 = PO^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ 25 = PO^2 + \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4} \]
\[ 25 = PO^2 + \frac{18}{4} \]
\[ 25 = PO^2 + 4.5 \]
\[ PO^2 = 25 - 4.5 \]
\[ PO^2 = 20.5 \]
\[ PO = \sqrt{20.5} \]

Now, we need to find the volume of the solid formed by rotating \( \triangle POA \) around \( PO \). This solid is a cone with height \( PO \) and base radius \( AO \).

The volume \( V \) of a cone is given by:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r = AO \) and \( h = PO \).

Substituting the values:
\[ r = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ h = \sqrt{20.5} \]

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \sqrt{20.5} \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{9 \cdot 2}{4}\right) \sqrt{20.5} \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{18}{4}\right) \sqrt{20.5} \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{9}{2}\right) \sqrt{20.5} \]
\[ V = \frac{3\pi \sqrt{20.5}}{2} \]

So, the volume of the solid is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{3\pi \sqrt{20.5}}{2}} \]

### Part (2)
Given:
- \( AP = AD \)
- \( E \) is the midpoint of \( PB \)

Since \( AP = AD \), the pyramid is a regular square pyramid with all edges equal.

To find the angle between line \( BD \) and plane \( AEC \), we need to use vector analysis.

1. **Find coordinates of points:**
   - Let \( A = (3, 3, 0) \)
   - \( B = (3, -3, 0) \)
   - \( C = (-3, -3, 0) \)
   - \( D = (-3, 3, 0) \)
   - \( P = (0, 0, 5) \)
   - \( E \) is the midpoint of \( PB \), so \( E = \left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right) \)

2. **Vectors:**
   - Vector \( \overrightarrow{BD} = (-3 - 3, 3 - (-3), 0 - 0) = (-6, 6, 0) \)
   - Vector \( \overrightarrow{AE} = \left(\frac{3}{2} - 3, -\frac{3}{2} - 3, \frac{5}{2} - 0\right) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{9}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right) \)
   - Vector \( \overrightarrow{CE} = \left(\frac{3}{2} - (-3), -\frac{3}{2} - (-3), \frac{5}{2} - 0\right) = \left(\frac{9}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right) \)

3. **Normal vector to plane \( AEC \):**
   - Cross product \( \overrightarrow{AE} \times \overrightarrow{CE} \):
     \[
     \overrightarrow{n} = \begin{vmatrix}
     \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
     -\frac{3}{2} & -\frac{9}{2} & \frac{5}{2} \\
     \frac{9}{2} & \frac{3}{2} & \frac{5}{2}
     \end{vmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{n} = \mathbf{i} \left(-\frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{2} - \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{2}\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(-\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{2} - \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{2}\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(-\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} - \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{2}\right)
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{n} = \mathbf{i} \left(-\frac{45}{4} - \frac{15}{4}\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(-\frac{15}{4} - \frac{45}{4}\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(-\frac{9}{4} - \frac{81}{4}\right)
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{n} = \mathbf{i} \left(-15\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(-15\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(-90\right)
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{n} = (-15, 15, -90)
     \]

4. **Angle between \( \overrightarrow{BD} \) and \( \overrightarrow{n} \):**
   - Dot product \( \overrightarrow{BD} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \):
     \[
     \overrightarrow{BD} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} = (-6, 6, 0) \cdot (-15, 15, -90) = (-6)(-15) + (6)(15) + (0)(-90) = 90 + 90 = 180
     \]
   - Magnitudes:
     \[
     |\overrightarrow{BD}| = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 6^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]
     \[
     |\overrightarrow{n}| = \sqrt{(-15)^2 + 15^2 + (-90)^2} = \sqrt{225 + 225 + 8100} = \sqrt{8550} = 15\sqrt{38}
     \]
   - Cosine of the angle:
     \[
     \cos \theta = \frac{\overrightarrow{BD} \cdot \overrightarrow{n}}{|\overrightarrow{BD}| |\overrightarrow{n}|} = \frac{180}{6\sqrt{2} \cdot 15\sqrt{38}} = \frac{180}{90\sqrt{76}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{76}} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{19}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}
     \]
   - Angle:
     \[
     \theta = \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}\right)
     \]

So, the angle between line \( BD \) and plane \( AEC \) is:
\[ \boxed{\cos^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}\right)} \]

#### 18
Prompt: If $f(x)=\log_a x(a>0, a \neq 1)$.
(1) $y=f(x)$ passes through $(4,2)$, find the solution set of $f(2x-2)<f(x)$?
(2) There exists an $x$ such that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence, find the range of values for $a$?

Response:

Given \( f(x) = \log_a x \) where \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \), we need to solve the following problems:

### Problem 1
The function \( y = f(x) \) passes through the point \( (4, 2) \). We need to find the solution set of \( f(2x-2) < f(x) \).

Since \( f(4) = 2 \), we have:
\[
\log_a 4 = 2 \implies a^2 = 4 \implies a = 2 \text{ (since } a > 0 \text{ and } a \neq 1\text{)}
\]
Thus, \( f(x) = \log_2 x \).

We need to solve \( f(2x-2) < f(x) \):
\[
\log_2 (2x-2) < \log_2 x
\]
Since the logarithm function is increasing, this inequality simplifies to:
\[
2x - 2 < x
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
2x - 2 < x \implies x < 2
\]
Additionally, for \( \log_2 (2x-2) \) to be defined, \( 2x - 2 > 0 \implies x > 1 \).

Combining these conditions, the solution set is:
\[
1 < x < 2
\]

### Problem 2
There exists an \( x \) such that \( f(x+1) \), \( f(ax) \), \( f(x+2) \) form an arithmetic sequence. We need to find the range of values for \( a \).

Since \( f(x) = \log_2 x \), the given terms are:
\[
f(x+1) = \log_2 (x+1), \quad f(ax) = \log_2 (ax), \quad f(x+2) = \log_2 (x+2)
\]
These form an arithmetic sequence, so:
\[
2 \log_2 (ax) = \log_2 (x+1) + \log_2 (x+2)
\]
Using the properties of logarithms:
\[
\log_2 (ax)^2 = \log_2 ((x+1)(x+2))
\]
Equating the arguments of the logarithms:
\[
(ax)^2 = (x+1)(x+2)
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
a^2 x^2 = x^2 + 3x + 2
\]
\[
(a^2 - 1)x^2 = 3x + 2
\]
For this to hold for some \( x \), the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant term must be zero. Thus, we solve:
\[
a^2 - 1 = 0 \implies a^2 = 1 \implies a = 1 \text{ or } a = -1
\]
Since \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \), we discard \( a = 1 \) and \( a = -1 \).

Thus, there is no valid \( a \) that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the range of values for \( a \) is:
\[
\boxed{\text{No valid } a}
\]

#### 19
Prompt: To understand the relationship between physical exercise duration and academic performance of junior high school students in a certain area, 580 students were sampled from 29,000 students in the region. The data on daily average exercise duration and academic performance are shown in the following table:
(1) How many students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour?
(2) Estimate the daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region (accurate to 0.1)?
(3) Is there a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours? Note: $\chi^2 = \frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$, $P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05$.

Response:

To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the data provided and apply statistical methods. Let's go through each part step-by-step.

### Part (1): Number of students exercising for more than 1 hour

First, we need to determine the proportion of students in the sample who exercise for more than 1 hour. Let's assume the data provided in the table is as follows (hypothetical data for illustration):

| Exercise Duration (hours) | Number of Students |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 0-1                       | 200                |
| 1-2                       | 250                |
| 2+                        | 130                |
| **Total**                 | **580**            |

From the table:
- Students exercising 1-2 hours: 250
- Students exercising more than 2 hours: 130

Total students exercising more than 1 hour = 250 + 130 = 380

Proportion of students exercising more than 1 hour in the sample = \( \frac{380}{580} \)

Now, we apply this proportion to the entire population of 29,000 students:

\[ \text{Estimated number of students} = 29000 \times \frac{380}{580} \]

\[ \text{Estimated number of students} = 29000 \times 0.6552 \approx 18900 \]

So, the number of students among the 29,000 in the region who exercise for more than 1 hour is approximately \( \boxed{18900} \).

### Part (2): Estimate the daily average exercise duration

To estimate the daily average exercise duration, we need to calculate the weighted average based on the sample data. Using the same hypothetical data:

| Exercise Duration (hours) | Number of Students |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 0-1                       | 200                |
| 1-2                       | 250                |
| 2+                        | 130                |
| **Total**                 | **580**            |

Assume the midpoints for each interval:
- 0-1 hours: midpoint = 0.5 hours
- 1-2 hours: midpoint = 1.5 hours
- 2+ hours: midpoint = 2.5 hours (assuming an average of 2.5 for simplicity)

Now, calculate the weighted average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{(200 \times 0.5) + (250 \times 1.5) + (130 \times 2.5)}{580} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{100 + 375 + 325}{580} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{800}{580} \approx 1.4 \]

So, the estimated daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region is \( \boxed{1.4} \) hours.

### Part (3): Association between excellent academic performance and exercise duration

To determine if there is a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours, we use the chi-square test.

Assume the following contingency table for academic performance and exercise duration (hypothetical data):

| Academic Performance | 1-2 hours | Other Durations | Total |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Excellent            | 120       | 80              | 200   |
| Not Excellent        | 130       | 250             | 380   |
| **Total**            | **250**   | **330**         | **580**|

Using the chi-square formula:

\[ \chi^2 = \frac{n(ad - bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)} \]

Where:
- \( n = 580 \)
- \( a = 120 \)
- \( b = 80 \)
- \( c = 130 \)
- \( d = 250 \)

Calculate \( ad - bc \):

\[ ad - bc = (120 \times 250) - (80 \times 130) \]

\[ ad - bc = 30000 - 10400 = 19600 \]

Now, calculate \( \chi^2 \):

\[ \chi^2 = \frac{580 \times 19600^2}{(200 \times 380 \times 250 \times 330)} \]

\[ \chi^2 = \frac{580 \times 384160000}{6270000000} \]

\[ \chi^2 \approx 3.55 \]

Since \( \chi^2 = 3.55 \) and \( P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05 \), we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.

Therefore, there is not enough evidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours at the 95% confidence level. The answer is \( \boxed{\text{No}} \).

Prompt: For the hyperbola $\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, $(b>0)$, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the left and right focal points, and line $l$ passing through point $M(-2,0)$ intersects the hyperbola $\Gamma$ at two points $P$ and $Q$, with point $P$ in the first quadrant,
(1) If $e=2$, find $b$?
(2) If $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $\triangle MA_2P$ is an isosceles triangle, find the coordinates of $P$?
(3) Draw a line through point $Q$ extending $OQ$ to intersect $\Gamma$ at point $R$. If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, find the range of values for $b$?

Response:

Given the hyperbola \(\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\) with \(b > 0\), and the eccentricity \(e = 2\), we need to solve the following problems:

### Part 1: Finding \(b\) given \(e = 2\)

The eccentricity \(e\) of a hyperbola is given by:
\[
e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}
\]
For the given hyperbola, \(a = 1\) (since the equation is \(x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\)). Substituting \(e = 2\) into the formula, we get:
\[
2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{1^2}}
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
4 = 1 + b^2
\]
Solving for \(b^2\):
\[
b^2 = 3
\]
Thus, \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

### Part 2: Finding the coordinates of \(P\) given \(b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\) and \(\triangle MA_2P\) is isosceles

Given \(b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\), the hyperbola equation becomes:
\[
x^2 - \frac{y^2}{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\right)^2} = 1 \implies x^2 - \frac{9y^2}{24} = 1 \implies x^2 - \frac{3y^2}{8} = 1
\]

The focal points \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are at \((-c, 0)\) and \((c, 0)\) respectively, where \(c = ae = 2\). Thus, \(A_1 = (-2, 0)\) and \(A_2 = (2, 0)\).

Since \(\triangle MA_2P\) is isosceles and \(M = (-2, 0)\), \(A_2 = (2, 0)\), the distance \(MA_2 = 4\). For \(\triangle MA_2P\) to be isosceles, \(MP = PA_2\).

Let \(P = (x, y)\). Since \(P\) lies on the hyperbola:
\[
x^2 - \frac{3y^2}{8} = 1
\]
The distance \(MP\) is:
\[
MP = \sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + y^2}
\]
The distance \(PA_2\) is:
\[
PA_2 = \sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + y^2}
\]
Setting \(MP = PA_2\):
\[
\sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + y^2}
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = (x - 2)^2 + y^2
\]
Simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = x^2 - 4x + 4
\]
\[
8x = 0 \implies x = 0
\]
However, \(P\) must be in the first quadrant, so this solution is not valid. We need to re-evaluate the isosceles condition or consider another approach.

### Part 3: Finding the range of values for \(b\) given \(\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1\)

Given the hyperbola \(\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), and the condition \(\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1\), we need to find the range of values for \(b\).

Since the problem involves vectors and dot products, we need to consider the geometric properties of the hyperbola and the specific points \(A_1, A_2, P, Q, R\). However, without additional specific coordinates or constraints, we cannot directly solve for \(b\) in this context.

Thus, the final answer for the range of values for \(b\) cannot be determined from the given information alone. Further details or constraints are needed to solve this part accurately.

Answer:(1) $b=\sqrt{3}$ (2) $P(2,2\sqrt{2})$ (3) $b \in (0, \sqrt{3})$

Prompt: For a function $f(x)$ and a point $M(a,b)$, let $s(x)=(x-a)^2+(f(x)-b)^2$. If $P(x_0,f(x_0))$ is the point where $s(x)$ reaches its minimum value, then $P$ is called the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$.
(1) For $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, $D=(0,+\infty)$, prove that for point $M(1,0)$, there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$;
(2) For $f(x)=e^x$, $D=R$, $M(1,0)$, please determine whether there exists a point that is the nearest point of $M$ on $f(x)$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$;
(3) Suppose $f(x)$ has a derivative, and $g(x)$ is always positive on the domain $R$. Let points $M_1(t-1,f(t)-g(t))$, $M_2(t+1,f(t)+g(t))$. If for any $t \in R$, there exists a point $P$ that is the nearest point of both $M_1$ and $M_2$, try to determine the monotonicity of $f(x)$.

Response:

Let's solve each part of the problem step-by-step.

### Part (1)
For \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) and \( M(1,0) \), we need to find the point \( P(x_0, f(x_0)) \) on the curve \( f(x) \) that minimizes the distance to \( M \).

The distance squared function is:
\[ s(x) = (x - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{x} - 0 \right)^2 = (x - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \]

To find the minimum, we take the derivative of \( s(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ s'(x) = 2(x - 1) - \frac{2}{x^3} \]

Setting \( s'(x) = 0 \):
\[ 2(x - 1) - \frac{2}{x^3} = 0 \]
\[ x - 1 = \frac{1}{x^3} \]
\[ x^4 - x^3 - 1 = 0 \]

This is a polynomial equation of degree 4. We need to check if there is a real positive root. By numerical methods or graphing, we can find that there is a positive root \( x_0 \) in the interval \( (0, +\infty) \).

Thus, there exists a point \( P \) such that \( P \) is the nearest point of \( M \) on \( f(x) \).

### Part (2)
For \( f(x) = e^x \) and \( M(1,0) \), we need to determine if there exists a point \( P \) such that the line \( MP \) is perpendicular to the tangent line of \( f(x) \) at \( P \).

The distance squared function is:
\[ s(x) = (x - 1)^2 + (e^x - 0)^2 = (x - 1)^2 + e^{2x} \]

To find the minimum, we take the derivative of \( s(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ s'(x) = 2(x - 1) + 2e^{2x} \cdot e^x = 2(x - 1) + 2e^{3x} \]

Setting \( s'(x) = 0 \):
\[ 2(x - 1) + 2e^{3x} = 0 \]
\[ x - 1 + e^{3x} = 0 \]

This is a transcendental equation. We need to check if there is a real root. By numerical methods or graphing, we can find that there is a real root \( x_0 \).

To check if the line \( MP \) is perpendicular to the tangent line at \( P \), we need:
\[ \frac{e^{x_0} - 0}{x_0 - 1} = -\frac{1}{f'(x_0)} = -\frac{1}{e^{x_0}} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ e^{x_0} (x_0 - 1) = -1 \]

This is consistent with the previous equation \( x - 1 + e^{3x} = 0 \).

Thus, there exists a point \( P \) such that the line \( MP \) is perpendicular to the tangent line of \( f(x) \) at \( P \).

### Part (3)
Given \( f(x) \) has a derivative and \( g(x) \) is always positive, we need to determine the monotonicity of \( f(x) \) given that there exists a point \( P \) that is the nearest point of both \( M_1(t-1, f(t)-g(t)) \) and \( M_2(t+1, f(t)+g(t)) \).

For \( P \) to be the nearest point to both \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \), the distances must be minimized simultaneously. This implies:
\[ (x - (t-1))^2 + (f(x) - (f(t) - g(t)))^2 \]
\[ (x - (t+1))^2 + (f(x) - (f(t) + g(t)))^2 \]

Taking derivatives and setting them to zero, we get:
\[ 2(x - (t-1)) + 2(f(x) - (f(t) - g(t))) f'(x) = 0 \]
\[ 2(x - (t+1)) + 2(f(x) - (f(t) + g(t))) f'(x) = 0 \]

Solving these equations, we find that \( f(x) \) must be linear. Thus, \( f(x) \) is monotonic.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\text{monotonic}} \]
