Prompt: 已知集合 $A = \{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$ ，$B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$ ，则 $A \cap B =$ ？ A. $\{-1, 0\}$ B. $\{2, 3\}$ C. $\{-3, -1, 0\}$ D. $\{-1, 0, 2\}$

Response:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We need to find the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cap B$.
2. Set $A$ is defined as $\{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$. This means that we need to find the values of $x$ such that $-5 < x^3 < 5$.
3. To solve this inequality, we can take the cube root of all parts: $-5 < x^3 < 5 \Rightarrow -\sqrt[3]{5} < x < \sqrt[3]{5}$.
4. Since $-\sqrt[3]{5} \approx -1.71$ and $\sqrt[3]{5} \approx 1.71$, we can conclude that $-1.71 < x < 1.71$.
5. Now, let's examine set $B$: $B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$. We need to find the elements of $B$ that also satisfy the inequality $-1.71 < x < 1.71$.
6. Clearly, $-3$ and $3$ do not satisfy this inequality, so they can be eliminated.
7. However, $-1$, $0$, and $2$ do satisfy the inequality.
8. Therefore, the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is $A \cap B = \boxed{\{-1, 0, 2\}}$.

The correct answer is D. $\{-1, 0, 2\}$.

Answer:A

#### 2
Prompt: 若 $\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$ ，则 $z =$？ A. $-1 - i$ B. $-1 + i$ C. $1 - i$ D. $1 + i$

Response:

Let's solve the equation step by step:

$$\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$$

 Multiply both sides by $z-1$ to get rid of the fraction:

$$z = (1+i)(z-1)$$

Expand the right-hand side:

$$z = z - 1 + iz - i$$

Rearrange the terms to get all the $z$ terms on one side:

$$z - iz = 1 - i$$

Factor out $z$ from the left-hand side:

$$z(1 - i) = 1 - i$$

Now, divide both sides by $1 - i$:

$$z = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i}$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$z = 1 + i$$

So, the correct answer is:

$$\boxed{\text{D. } 1 + i}$$

Answer:C

#### 3
Prompt: 已知向量 $a = (0,1)$ ，$b = (2,x)$ 。若 $b ⊥ (b - 4a)$ ，则 $x =$？ A. -2 B. -1 C. 1 D. 2

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given two vectors: $a = (0,1)$ and $b = (2,x)$. We are also told that $b$ is perpendicular to $(b - 4a)$.

First, let's calculate the vector $(b - 4a)$:

$$b - 4a = (2,x) - 4(0,1) = (2,x) - (0,4) = (2,x-4)$$

Now, we are told that $b$ is perpendicular to $(b - 4a)$. This means that the dot product of $b$ and $(b - 4a)$ is equal to zero:

$$b \cdot (b - 4a) = 0$$

Expanding the dot product, we get:

$$(2,x) \cdot (2,x-4) = 0$$

$$2(2) + x(x-4) = 0$$

$$4 + x^2 - 4x = 0$$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$$

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

$$(x-2)^2 = 0$$

This implies that:

$$x-2 = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = \boxed{2}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 2.

Answer:D

#### 4
Prompt: 已知 $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$ ，$\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$ ，则 $\cos(\alpha - \beta) =$ ？ A. $-3m$ B. $\frac{m}{3}$ C. $\frac{m}{3}$ D. $3m$

Response:

Let's break it down step by step.

We are given:

1. $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$
2. $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$

We need to find $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$.

First, let's recall the trigonometric identity:

$$\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$$

Using this identity, we can rewrite equation (1) as:

$$\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = m$$

Now, let's focus on equation (2). We can rewrite it as:

$$\tan \alpha \tan \beta = \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha} \cdot \frac{\sin \beta}{\cos \beta} = 2$$

Multiplying both sides by $\cos \alpha \cos \beta$, we get:

$$\sin \alpha \sin \beta = 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta$$

Now, let's substitute this expression into equation (1):

$$\cos \alpha \cos \beta - 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta = m$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$-\cos \alpha \cos \beta = m$$

Now, we can use another trigonometric identity:

$$\cos(A-B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B$$

Using this identity, we can write:

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta$$

Substituting the expressions we found earlier, we get:

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = -m + 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta$$

Using equation (1) again, we can rewrite this as:

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = -m + 2(-m)$$

Simplifying, we finally get:

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \boxed{\frac{m}{3}}$$

So, the correct answer is C. $\frac{m}{3}$.

Answer:A

#### 5
Prompt: 已知圆柱体和圆锥体的底面半径相等 ，侧面积相等 ，且他们的高均为 $\sqrt{3}$ ，则圆锥体的体积为？ A. $2\sqrt{3}\pi$ B. $3\sqrt{3}\pi$ C. $6\sqrt{3}\pi$ D. $9\sqrt{3}\pi$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bases of the cylinder and the cone have the same radius, which we'll call $r$.
2. The lateral surface areas of the cylinder and the cone are equal. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is $2\pi rh$, where $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The lateral surface area of a cone is $\pi rl$, where $l$ is the slant height of the cone. Since the heights of both shapes are $\sqrt{3}$, we can set up the equation:

$$2\pi r\sqrt{3} = \pi rl$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$2\sqrt{3} = l$$

So, the slant height of the cone is $2\sqrt{3}$.

3. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the base:

$$r^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 = (2\sqrt{3})^2$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$r^2 + 3 = 12$$

$$r^2 = 9$$

$$r = 3$$

So, the radius of the base is 3.

4. Finally, we can find the volume of the cone:

$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi (3)^2 \sqrt{3}$$

$$V = 3\sqrt{3}\pi$$

So, the correct answer is:

\boxed{B. $3\sqrt{3}\pi$}

Answer:B

#### 6
Prompt: 已知函数为 $f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 - 2ax - a, & x < 0 \\ e^x + \ln(x+1), & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$ 在 $R$ 上单调递增，则 $a$ 的取值范围是？ A. $(-\infty, 0]$ B. $[-1, 0]$ C. $[-1, 1]$ D. $[0, +\infty)$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since the function $f(x)$ is defined piecewise, we need to consider the monotonicity of each piece separately.

**For $x < 0$:**

The derivative of $f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a$ is $f'(x) = -2x - 2a$. For $f(x)$ to be monotonically increasing, we need $f'(x) \geq 0$. Since $x < 0$, we have $-2x > 0$, so we need $-2a \geq 0$, which implies $a \leq 0$.

**For $x \geq 0$:**

The derivative of $f(x) = e^x + \ln(x+1)$ is $f'(x) = e^x + \frac{1}{x+1}$. For $f(x)$ to be monotonically increasing, we need $f'(x) \geq 0$. Since $e^x > 0$ and $\frac{1}{x+1} > 0$ for $x \geq 0$, we have $f'(x) > 0$, which is always true.

**Continuity at $x = 0$:**

Since $f(x)$ is defined piecewise, we need to ensure that the function is continuous at $x = 0$. We have:

$$\lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^-} (-x^2 - 2ax - a) = -a$$

$$\lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} (e^x + \ln(x+1)) = 1 + \ln(1) = 1$$

For continuity, we need $-a = 1$, which implies $a = -1$.

**Combining the results:**

From the analysis above, we have $a \leq 0$ and $a = -1$. Therefore, the only possible value of $a$ is $a = -1$, which is in the range $[-1, 0]$.

So, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{B. [-1, 0]}$$

Answer:B

#### 7
Prompt: 当 $x \in [0, 2\pi]$ 时，曲线 $y = \sin x$ 与 $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ 的交点个数为？ A. 3 B. 4 C. 6 D. 8

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to find the intersection points of the two curves $y = \sin x$ and $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ in the interval $x \in [0, 2\pi]$.

2. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:

$$\sin x = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$$

3. Now, we can use the trigonometric identity $\sin(a) = \sin(b)$ if and only if $a = b + 2k\pi$ or $a = \pi - b + 2k\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.

4. Applying this identity to our equation, we get:

$$x = 3x - \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pi - (3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) + 2k\pi$$

5. Simplifying the first equation, we get:

$$2x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{\pi}{12} + k\pi$$

6. Simplifying the second equation, we get:

$$4x = \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{7\pi}{24} + \frac{k\pi}{2}$$

7. Now, we need to find the values of $k$ such that $x \in [0, 2\pi]$. For the first equation, we get:

$$k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$

For the second equation, we get:

$$k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$$

8. Therefore, we have a total of 6 + 5 = 11 possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equations. However, we need to check if these values are actually intersection points of the two curves.

9. By plotting the two curves, we can see that there are 6 intersection points in the interval $x \in [0, 2\pi]$.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$$\boxed{C. 6}$$

Answer:C

#### 8
Prompt: 已知函数 $f(x)$ 的定义域为 $R$ ，$f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$，且当 $x < 3 时 f(x) = x$ ， 则下列结论中一定正确的是？ A. $f(10) > 100$ B. $f(20) > 1000$ C. $f(10) < 1000$ D. $f(20) < 10000$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that $f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, which is $\mathbb{R}$.
2. We also know that $f(x) = x$ for $x < 3$.

Let's start by finding $f(3)$. Since $f(3) > f(2) + f(1)$, and $f(2) = 2$ and $f(1) = 1$, we have:

$$f(3) > 2 + 1 = 3$$

So, $f(3) \ge 4$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$. Since $f(4) > f(3) + f(2)$, and $f(3) \ge 4$ and $f(2) = 2$, we have:

$$f(4) > 4 + 2 = 6$$

So, $f(4) \ge 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find:

$$f(5) > f(4) + f(3) \ge 7 + 4 = 11$$
$$f(6) > f(5) + f(4) \ge 11 + 7 = 18$$
$$f(7) > f(6) + f(5) \ge 18 + 11 = 29$$
$$f(8) > f(7) + f(6) \ge 29 + 18 = 47$$
$$f(9) > f(8) + f(7) \ge 47 + 29 = 76$$
$$f(10) > f(9) + f(8) \ge 76 + 47 = 123$$

So, $f(10) \ge 123$.

Similarly, we can find:

$$f(11) > f(10) + f(9) \ge 123 + 76 = 199$$
$$f(12) > f(11) + f(10) \ge 199 + 123 = 322$$
$$f(13) > f(12) + f(11) \ge 322 + 199 = 521$$
$$f(14) > f(13) + f(12) \ge 521 + 322 = 843$$
$$f(15) > f(14) + f(13) \ge 843 + 521 = 1364$$
$$f(16) > f(15) + f(14) \ge 1364 + 843 = 2207$$
$$f(17) > f(16) + f(15) \ge 2207 + 1364 = 3571$$
$$f(18) > f(17) + f(16) \ge 3571 + 2207 = 5778$$
$$f(19) > f(18) + f(17) \ge 5778 + 3571 = 9349$$
$$f(20) > f(19) + f(18) \ge 9349 + 5778 = 15127$$

So, $f(20) \ge 15127$.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. $f(10) > 100$: True, since $f(10) \ge 123$.

B. $f(20) > 1000$: True, since $f(20) \ge 15127$.

C. $f(10) < 1000$: False, since $f(10) \ge 123$.

D. $f(20) < 10000$: False, since $f(20) \ge 15127$.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

\boxed{A, B}

Answer:B

Prompt: 为了解推动出口后的亩收入（单位：万元）情况，从种植区抽取样本，得到推动出口后亩收入的样本均值为 $\bar{x}=2. 1$ ，样本方差 $s^2=0.01$ 。已知该种植区以往的亩收入服从正态分布 $M(1.8, 0.1^2)$ ，假设推动出口后的亩收入 $Y$ 服从正态分布 $N(\bar{x},s^2)$ ，则？（若随机变量 $Z$ 服从正态分布 $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ ，则 $P(Z < \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.8413$ ） A. $P(X > 2) > 0.2$ B. $P(X > 2) < 0.5$ C. $P(Y > 2) > 0.5$ D. $P(Y > 2) < 0.8$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the sample mean of the per-acre income after exporting is $\bar{x} = 2.1$, and the sample variance is $s^2 = 0.01$. We are also told that the per-acre income before exporting follows a normal distribution $M(1.8, 0.1^2)$.

First, let's find the probability that the per-acre income after exporting, $Y$, is greater than 2. Since $Y$ follows a normal distribution $N(\bar{x}, s^2) = N(2.1, 0.01)$, we can standardize the value 2 by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:

$Z = \frac{Y - 2.1}{\sqrt{0.01}} = \frac{Y - 2.1}{0.1}$

We want to find $P(Y > 2) = P(Z > \frac{2 - 2.1}{0.1}) = P(Z > -0.9)$. Since $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, we can use the z-table to find the probability:

$P(Z > -0.9) = 1 - P(Z < -0.9) = 1 - 0.1841 = 0.8159$

Now, let's compare this result to the options:

A. $P(X > 2) > 0.2$: We are not given any information about $X$, so we cannot determine this probability.

B. $P(X > 2) < 0.5$: Same as above.

C. $P(Y > 2) > 0.5$: This is true, since we found that $P(Y > 2) = 0.8159 > 0.5$.

D. $P(Y > 2) < 0.8$: This is false, since we found that $P(Y > 2) = 0.8159 > 0.8$.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{C}

#### 10
Prompt: 设函数 $f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)$ ，则？ A. $x = 3$ 是 $f(x)$ 的极小值点 B. 当 $0 < x < 1$ 时，$f(x) < f(x^2)$ C. 当 $1 < x < 2$ 时，$-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$ D. 当 $-1 < x < 0$ 时，$f(2 - x) > f(x)$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**A. $x = 3$ is the local minimum point of $f(x)$**

To find the local minimum or maximum points, we need to find the critical points of $f(x)$ by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

$$f'(x) = 2(x-1)(x-4) + (x-1)^2 = (x-1)(3x-10) = 0$$

This gives us two critical points: $x = 1$ and $x = \frac{10}{3}$. To determine whether $x = 3$ is a local minimum, we need to check the sign of the second derivative at $x = 3$:

$$f''(x) = 6x - 14$$

At $x = 3$, we have $f''(3) = 6(3) - 14 = 4 > 0$, which indicates that $x = 3$ is a local minimum point.

**B. When $0 < x < 1$, $f(x) < f(x^2)$**

Let's analyze the inequality:

$$f(x) < f(x^2)$$

$$\Rightarrow (x-1)^2(x-4) < (x^2-1)^2(x^2-4)$$

Since $0 < x < 1$, we have $x^2 < x$, so $x^2 - 1 < x - 1$ and $x^2 - 4 < x - 4$. Therefore, the inequality holds.

**C. When $1 < x < 2$, $-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$**

Let's analyze the inequality:

$$-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$$

$$\Rightarrow -4 < ((2x-1)-1)^2((2x-1)-4) < 0$$

$$\Rightarrow -4 < (2x-2)^2(2x-5) < 0$$

Since $1 < x < 2$, we have $0 < 2x-2 < 2$ and $-3 < 2x-5 < -1$. Therefore, the inequality holds.

**D. When $-1 < x < 0$, $f(2 - x) > f(x)$**

Let's analyze the inequality:

$$f(2 - x) > f(x)$$

$$\Rightarrow ((2-x)-1)^2((2-x)-4) > (x-1)^2(x-4)$$

$$\Rightarrow (1-x)^2(-2-x) > (x-1)^2(x-4)$$

Since $-1 < x < 0$, we have $0 < 1-x < 2$ and $-2 < -2-x < -1$. Therefore, the inequality holds.

**Final Answer**

The correct answers are:

$$\boxed{\text{A, B, C, D}}$$

Prompt: 造型 $\alpha$ 可以看作图中的曲线 $C$ 的一部分。已知 $C$ 过坐标原点 $O$，且 $C$ 上的点满足横坐标大于 -2；到点 $F(2,0)$ 的距离与到定直线 $x = a(a < 0)$ 的距离之积为 4，则？ A. $a = -2$ B. 点 $(2√2,0)$ 在 $C$ 上 C. $C$ 在第一象限的点的纵坐标的最大值为 1 D. 当点 $(x_0,y_0)$ 在 $C$ 上时， $y0 ≤ \frac{4}{(x_0 + 2)}$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The curve $C$ passes through the origin $O(0,0)$.
2. The $x$-coordinate of any point on $C$ is greater than or equal to $-2$.
3. The product of the distance from a point on $C$ to the point $F(2,0)$ and the distance from the same point to the line $x=a$ is equal to $4$.

Let's consider a point $(x,y)$ on the curve $C$. The distance from $(x,y)$ to $F(2,0)$ is $\sqrt{(x-2)^2+y^2}$. The distance from $(x,y)$ to the line $x=a$ is $|x-a|$. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$$\sqrt{(x-2)^2+y^2}\cdot|x-a|=4$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$(x-2)^2+y^2=(4/|x-a|)^2$$

Since $a<0$, we know that $|x-a|=-(x-a)$. Substituting this, we get:

$$(x-2)^2+y^2=\frac{16}{(x-a)^2}$$

Multiplying both sides by $(x-a)^2$, we get:

$$(x-2)^2(x-a)^2+y^2(x-a)^2=16$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$x^4-4x^3+(4a+4)x^2-(8a+8)x+(4a+4)y^2=16$$

Since the curve passes through the origin, we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ to get:

$$4a+4=16\Rightarrow a=-2$$

So, the correct answer is $\boxed{A. a=-2}$.

Now, let's check the other options:

B. The point $(2\sqrt{2},0)$ is not on the curve $C$, since it does not satisfy the equation above.

C. The curve $C$ does not have a maximum $y$-value of $1$ in the first quadrant. In fact, the curve can have arbitrarily large $y$-values.

D. The inequality $y_0\leq\frac{4}{x_0+2}$ is not always true for points on the curve $C$. For example, the point $(0,2)$ is on the curve, but it does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the correct answer is only $\boxed{A. a=-2}$.

Answer:ABD

Prompt: 设双曲线 $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0，b > 0)$ 的左右焦点分别为 $F_1$ ，$F_2$，过 $F_2$ 做平行于 $y$ 轴的直线交 $C$ 于 $A$ ，$B$ 两点，若 $|F_1A| = 13$ ，$|AB| = 10$ ，则 $C$ 的离心率为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Since $F_2$ is a focus of the hyperbola $C$, its coordinates are $(ae, 0)$, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the hyperbola.

2. The line through $F_2$ parallel to the $y$-axis has equation $x = ae$. This line intersects the hyperbola $C$ at points $A$ and $B$.

3. Substituting $x = ae$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get:

$$\frac{(ae)^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \Rightarrow y^2 = b^2(e^2 - 1)$$

Since $A$ and $B$ are on the hyperbola, they have the same $x$-coordinate $ae$, and their $y$-coordinates are $\pm\sqrt{b^2(e^2 - 1)}$.

4. The distance between $F_1$ and $A$ is $|F_1A| = 13$. Since $F_1$ has coordinates $(-ae, 0)$, we can write:

$$|F_1A| = \sqrt{(ae + ae)^2 + (\sqrt{b^2(e^2 - 1)})^2} = 13$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$2ae = \sqrt{13^2 - b^2(e^2 - 1)}$$

5. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|AB| = 10$. Since $A$ and $B$ have the same $x$-coordinate $ae$, we can write:

$$|AB| = 2\sqrt{b^2(e^2 - 1)} = 10$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$b^2(e^2 - 1) = 25$$

6. Now we can use the two equations we obtained:

$$2ae = \sqrt{13^2 - b^2(e^2 - 1)}$$
$$b^2(e^2 - 1) = 25$$

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

$$2ae = \sqrt{13^2 - 25} = \sqrt{144} = 12$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$ae = 6$$

7. Finally, we can use the fact that $a^2 = b^2(e^2 - 1)$ to express $e$ in terms of $a$:

$$e = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}$$

Substituting $ae = 6$ and $b^2(e^2 - 1) = 25$, we get:

$$6 = a\left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + 25/a^2}}{a}\right) \Rightarrow a^2 = 36 \Rightarrow a = 6$$

$$b^2(e^2 - 1) = 25 \Rightarrow b^2 = \frac{25}{e^2 - 1} = \frac{25}{(\sqrt{a^2 + 25/a^2}/a)^2 - 1} = \frac{25}{(6/\sqrt{36 + 25/36})^2 - 1} = 5$$

Now we can calculate the eccentricity:

$$e = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} = \frac{\sqrt{36 + 5}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{6}$$

So, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{e = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{6}}$$

Answer:$\frac{3}{2}$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find the derivative of $y = e^x + x$**

Using the chain rule and the fact that $\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$, we get:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x + 1$$

**Step 2: Find the slope of the tangent line to $y = e^x + x$ at $(0, 1)$**

Evaluate the derivative at $x = 0$:

$$\frac{dy}{dx}\bigg|_{x=0} = e^0 + 1 = 2$$

So, the slope of the tangent line is 2.

**Step 3: Find the derivative of $y = \ln(x+1) + a$**

Using the chain rule and the fact that $\frac{d}{dx} \ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, we get:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x+1}$$

**Step 4: Find the slope of the tangent line to $y = \ln(x+1) + a$ at the point where it intersects with the tangent line to $y = e^x + x$**

Since the two tangent lines are the same, they must have the same slope. Therefore, we set:

$$\frac{1}{x+1} = 2$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = -\frac{1}{2}$$

**Step 5: Find the value of $a$**

Now, we need to find the value of $a$ such that the point $(-\frac{1}{2}, \ln(\frac{1}{2} + 1) + a)$ lies on the tangent line to $y = e^x + x$ at $(0, 1)$.

The equation of the tangent line is:

$$y - 1 = 2(x - 0) \Rightarrow y = 2x + 1$$

Substitute $x = -\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation:

$$y = 2(-\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = 0$$

Now, equate the $y$-value to $\ln(\frac{1}{2} + 1) + a$:

$$0 = \ln(\frac{1}{2} + 1) + a \Rightarrow a = -\ln(\frac{3}{2})$$

So, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{a = -\ln(\frac{3}{2})}$$

Answer:$\ln2$

Prompt: 甲、乙两人各有四张卡片。每张卡片上标有一个数字，甲的卡片上分别标有数字 1，3，5，7。乙的卡片上分别标有数字 2，4，6，8。两人进行四轮比赛。在每轮比赛中，两人各自自持有的卡片中随机选一张，并比较所选卡片上数字的大小。数字大的得 1 分，数字小的得 0 分。然后各自弃置此轮所选的卡片（弃置的卡片在此后的轮次中不能使用），则四轮比赛后，甲的总得分不小于 2 的概率为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Analyze the cards**
甲 (Player A) has cards with numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 乙 (Player B) has cards with numbers 2, 4, 6, 8.

**Step 2: Understand the game rules**
In each round, both players randomly select one card from their respective decks, compare the numbers, and the player with the larger number gets 1 point, while the other player gets 0 points. The selected cards are then discarded and cannot be used in subsequent rounds.

**Step 3: Identify the favorable outcomes for 甲**
For 甲 to win at least 2 rounds, they need to win either 2, 3, or 4 rounds. Let's analyze each case:

* **Win 2 rounds**: 甲 needs to win exactly 2 rounds and lose exactly 2 rounds. There are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose the 2 winning rounds out of 4 rounds.
* **Win 3 rounds**: 甲 needs to win exactly 3 rounds and lose exactly 1 round. There are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ ways to choose the 3 winning rounds out of 4 rounds.
* **Win 4 rounds**: 甲 needs to win all 4 rounds. There is only 1 way to achieve this.

**Step 4: Calculate the probability of each favorable outcome**
Let's calculate the probability of each favorable outcome:

* **Win 2 rounds**: In each of the 2 winning rounds, 甲 needs to draw a card with a larger number than 乙's card. The probability of this happening in a single round is $\frac{3}{4}$, since 甲 has 3 cards with larger numbers than 乙's smallest card (2). Therefore, the probability of winning 2 rounds is $(\frac{3}{4})^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. Since there are 6 ways to choose the 2 winning rounds, the total probability is $6 \times \frac{9}{16} = \frac{27}{32}$.
* **Win 3 rounds**: In each of the 3 winning rounds, 甲 needs to draw a card with a larger number than 乙's card. The probability of this happening in a single round is $\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the probability of winning 3 rounds is $(\frac{3}{4})^3 = \frac{27}{64}$. Since there are 4 ways to choose the 3 winning rounds, the total probability is $4 \times \frac{27}{64} = \frac{27}{32}$.
* **Win 4 rounds**: In each round, 甲 needs to draw a card with a larger number than 乙's card. The probability of this happening in a single round is $\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the probability of winning all 4 rounds is $(\frac{3}{4})^4 = \frac{81}{256}$.

**Step 5: Calculate the total probability**
The total probability of 甲 winning at least 2 rounds is the sum of the probabilities of each favorable outcome:

$$P(\text{Win at least 2 rounds}) = \frac{27}{32} + \frac{27}{32} + \frac{81}{256} = \frac{243}{256}$$

Therefore, the probability of 甲 winning at least 2 rounds is $\boxed{\frac{243}{256}}$.

Answer:$\frac{1}{2}$

Prompt: 记 $\triangle ABC$ 的内角 $A，B，C$ 的对边分别为 $a，b，c$ ，已知 $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$，$a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$。(1) 求 $B$；(2) 若 $\triangle ABC$ 的面积为 $3 + \sqrt{3}$，求 $c$。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) Find angle B**

We are given $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$. Using the trigonometric identity $\sin C = \cos (90^\circ - C)$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$\cos (90^\circ - C) = \sqrt{2} \cos B$$

Now, we can use the cosine of a difference formula:

$$\cos (90^\circ - C) = \sin C = \cos 90^\circ \cos C + \sin 90^\circ \sin C = \sin C$$

So, we have:

$$\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$\sin^2 C = 2 \cos^2 B$$

Using the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2 C + \cos^2 C = 1$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$1 - \cos^2 C = 2 \cos^2 B$$

Now, we can use the cosine of a difference formula again:

$$\cos C = \cos 90^\circ \cos B - \sin 90^\circ \sin B = 0 - \sin B = - \sin B$$

So, we have:

$$\cos^2 C = \sin^2 B$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$1 - \sin^2 B = 2 \cos^2 B$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\sin^2 B + 2 \cos^2 B = 1$$

Factoring out $\cos^2 B$, we get:

$$\cos^2 B (\sin^2 B + 2) = 1$$

Since $\cos^2 B \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\cos^2 B$ to get:

$$\sin^2 B + 2 = \frac{1}{\cos^2 B} = \sec^2 B$$

Using the Pythagorean identity again, we get:

$$\tan^2 B + 1 + 2 = \sec^2 B$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\tan^2 B + 3 = \sec^2 B$$

Factoring out $\sec^2 B$, we get:

$$\sec^2 B (\tan^2 B - 1) = -3$$

Since $\sec^2 B \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\sec^2 B$ to get:

$$\tan^2 B - 1 = -3$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\tan^2 B = -2$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$\tan B = \pm \sqrt{-2} = \pm i \sqrt{2}$$

Since $B$ is a real angle, we take the positive value:

$$\tan B = i \sqrt{2}$$

Using the arctangent function, we get:

$$B = \arctan (i \sqrt{2}) = \boxed{45^\circ}$$

**(2) Find c**

We are given that the area of the triangle is $3 + \sqrt{3}$. Using Heron's formula, we can write the area as:

$$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$$

where $s$ is the semi-perimeter:

$$s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$3 + \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$$

Now, we can use the law of cosines:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$$

Substituting the given equation $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$, we get:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-a^2 - b^2 + \sqrt{2}ab)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3 = s(s-a)(s-b)(\sqrt{2}ab - a^2 - b^2 + s)$$

Now, we can use the fact that $B = 45^\circ$ to simplify the equation. Using the law of sines, we can write:

$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$

Substituting $B = 45^\circ$, we get:

$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin 45^\circ} = \frac{b}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}b$$

Similarly, we can write:

$$\frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} = \frac{c}{\sin (90^\circ - B)} = \frac{c}{\cos B} = \frac{c}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}c$$

Equating the two expressions, we get:

$$a = c$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3 = s(s-a)^2 (\sqrt{2}a^2 - a^2 - a^2 + s)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3 = s(s-a)^2 (\sqrt{2} - 2)a^2$$

Dividing both sides by $(s-a)^2 a^2$, we get:

$$\frac{12 + 6 \sqrt{3} + 3}{(s-a)^2 a^2} = \sqrt{2} - 2$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$s-a = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 2}}$$

Substituting $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$ and $a = c$, we get:

$$\frac{b}{2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 2}}$$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = \frac{6 + 2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 2}}$$

Now, we can use the law of cosines again:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab$$

Substituting $a = c$ and the expression for $b$, we get:

$$c^2 = c^2 + \left( \frac{6 + 2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 2}} \right)^2 - \sqrt{2}c \left( \frac{6 + 2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 2}} \right)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$c = \boxed{2 + \sqrt{2}}$$

Answer:（1）$B = \frac{\pi}{3}$（2）$c = 2\sqrt{2}$

#### 16
Prompt: 已知 $A(0,3)$ 和 $P(3,\frac{3}{2})$ 为椭圆 $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1(a > b > 0)$ 上两点。(1) 求 $C$ 的离心率；(2) 若过 $P$ 的直线 $l$ 交 $C$ 于另一点 $B$，且 $\triangle ABP$ 的面积为 9，求 $l$ 的方程。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) Find the eccentricity of the ellipse**

Since $A(0,3)$ lies on the ellipse, we know that $b=3$. Also, since $P(3,\frac{3}{2})$ lies on the ellipse, we can plug in the coordinates to get:

$$\frac{3^2}{a^2} + \frac{(\frac{3}{2})^2}{3^2} = 1$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{9}{a^2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1$$

$$\frac{9}{a^2} = \frac{3}{4}$$

$$a^2 = 12$$

$$a = 2\sqrt{3}$$

Now, we can find the eccentricity $e$ using the formula:

$$e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$$

$$e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3^2}{(2\sqrt{3})^2}}$$

$$e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}}$$

$$e = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}$$

$$e = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$

**(2) Find the equation of line $l$**

Let's denote the coordinates of point $B$ as $(x_B, y_B)$. Since $B$ lies on the ellipse, we know that:

$$\frac{x_B^2}{a^2} + \frac{y_B^2}{b^2} = 1$$

We are also given that the area of triangle $ABP$ is 9. Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_P - x_A)(y_B - y_A) - (x_B - x_A)(y_P - y_A) \right| = 9$$

Plugging in the coordinates, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (3 - 0)(y_B - 3) - (x_B - 0)(\frac{3}{2} - 3) \right| = 9$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| 3y_B - 9 - \frac{3}{2}x_B + \frac{9}{2} \right| = 9$$

$$\left| 3y_B - \frac{3}{2}x_B - \frac{9}{2} \right| = 18$$

$$3y_B - \frac{3}{2}x_B - \frac{9}{2} = \pm 18$$

Now, we can solve for $y_B$ in terms of $x_B$:

$$y_B = \frac{1}{2}x_B + 3 \pm 6$$

Since $B$ lies on the ellipse, we can substitute this expression for $y_B$ into the equation of the ellipse:

$$\frac{x_B^2}{a^2} + \frac{(\frac{1}{2}x_B + 3 \pm 6)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Simplifying and solving for $x_B$, we get:

$$x_B = -3 \text{ or } x_B = 9$$

Using these values, we can find the corresponding values of $y_B$:

$$y_B = 3 \text{ or } y_B = -\frac{3}{2}$$

Now, we can find the equation of line $l$ using the point-slope form:

$$y - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{y_B - \frac{3}{2}}{x_B - 3}(x - 3)$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$y - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 - \frac{3}{2}}{-3 - 3}(x - 3) \text{ or } y - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{-\frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2}}{9 - 3}(x - 3)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$y - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(x - 3) \text{ or } y - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 3)$$

Combining these two equations, we get the final equation of line $l$:

$$\boxed{y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1}$$

Answer:（1）$\frac{1}{2}$（2）$y = \frac{1}{2} x$ 或 $y = \frac{3}{2} x -3$

#### 17
Prompt: 如图，四棱锥 $P-ANCD$ 中，$PA \perp$ 底面 $ABCD$ ，$PA = AC = 2$ ，$BC = 1$ ，$AB = \sqrt{3}$。(1) 若 $AD \perp AB$，证明：$AD \parallel$ 平面 $PBC$；(2) 若 $AD \perp DC$，且三面角 $A-CP-D$ 的正弦值为 $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$，求 $AD$。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) Prove that $AD \parallel$ plane $PBC$ if $AD \perp AB$**

Since $PA \perp$ base $ABCD$, we have $PA \perp AB$. Also, given that $AD \perp AB$, we have $AD \perp PA$. Therefore, $AD$ and $PA$ are perpendicular to the same line $AB$, which implies that $AD \parallel PA$.

Now, consider the plane $PBC$. Since $PA \perp$ base $ABCD$, we have $PA \perp BC$. Also, $PA \parallel AD$, so $AD \perp BC$. Therefore, $AD$ is perpendicular to two lines $PB$ and $BC$ in the plane $PBC$, which implies that $AD \parallel$ plane $PBC$.

**(2) Find $AD$ if $AD \perp DC$ and $\sin \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$**

Since $AD \perp DC$, we have $AD \perp CP$. Also, $AC = 2$, so $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with legs $AC = 2$ and $CD$. Let $CD = x$.

Now, consider $\triangle ACP$. We have $\angle ACP = 90^\circ - \angle DCP$, and $\sin \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$. Using the Pythagorean identity, we have:

$$\cos \angle DCP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} \Rightarrow \tan \angle DCP = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{42}{49}}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{42}}$$

Since $\tan \angle DCP = \frac{CD}{AC} = \frac{x}{2}$, we have:

$$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{42}} \Rightarrow x = \frac{14}{\sqrt{42}} = \frac{2\sqrt{42}}{7}$$

Now, we can find $AD$ using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ACD$:

$$AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 = 2^2 + \left(\frac{2\sqrt{42}}{7}\right)^2 = 4 + \frac{48}{49} = \frac{256}{49} \Rightarrow AD = \boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{14}}{7}}$$

Answer:（1）$AD \parallel$ 平面 $PBC$（2）$\sqrt{3}$

#### 18
Prompt: 已知函数 $f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$，(1) 若 $b = 0$，且 $f'(x) \geq 0$，求 $a$ 的最小值；(2) 证明：曲线 $y = f(x)$ 是中心对称图形；(3) 若 $f(x) > -2$ 当且仅当 $1 < x < 2$，求 $b$ 的取值范围。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) Find the minimum value of $a$ when $b=0$ and $f'(x) \geq 0$**

First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:

$$f'(x) = \frac{2-x-x}{(2-x)x} + a - 3b(x-1)^2$$

Since $b=0$, we have:

$$f'(x) = \frac{2-2x}{(2-x)x} + a$$

For $f'(x) \geq 0$, we need:

$$\frac{2-2x}{(2-x)x} + a \geq 0$$

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

$$a \geq \frac{2x-2}{x(2-x)}$$

To find the minimum value of $a$, we need to find the maximum value of $\frac{2x-2}{x(2-x)}$. Let's analyze the function:

$$g(x) = \frac{2x-2}{x(2-x)}$$

The domain of $g(x)$ is $x \in (0, 2) \setminus \{1\}$. Taking the derivative of $g(x)$, we get:

$$g'(x) = \frac{2(x-1)^2}{x^2(2-x)^2}$$

The derivative is always positive, so $g(x)$ is an increasing function. Therefore, the maximum value of $g(x)$ occurs at $x=1-$ (i.e., as $x$ approaches 1 from the left). Evaluating the limit, we get:

$$\lim_{x \to 1-} g(x) = 2$$

So, the minimum value of $a$ is:

$$\boxed{a \geq 2}$$

**(2) Prove that the curve $y=f(x)$ is centrally symmetric**

A curve is centrally symmetric if it remains unchanged when reflected about its center. Let's find the center of the curve.

The curve is defined as:

$$y = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$$

Completing the square, we get:

$$y = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b\left(x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1\right)$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$y = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b$$

The center of the curve is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(0, f(0))$ and $(2, f(2))$. Evaluating the function at these points, we get:

$$f(0) = -\ln 2 + b$$
$$f(2) = \ln 2 + 2a + 7b$$

The midpoint is:

$$\left(1, \frac{f(0) + f(2)}{2}\right) = \left(1, \frac{-\ln 2 + b + \ln 2 + 2a + 7b}{2}\right) = \left(1, a + 4b\right)$$

Now, let's reflect the curve about its center. Substituting $x' = 2-x$ and $y' = 2a + 8b - y$, we get:

$$y' = 2a + 8b - \left(\ln \frac{x'}{2-x'} + ax' + bx'^3 - 3bx'^2 + 3bx' - b\right)$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$y' = \ln \frac{x'}{2-x'} + ax' + bx'^3 - 3bx'^2 + 3bx' - b$$

This is the same as the original curve. Therefore, the curve $y=f(x)$ is centrally symmetric.

**(3) Find the range of $b$ when $f(x) > -2$ if and only if $1 < x < 2$**

From part (2), we know that the curve is centrally symmetric about the point $(1, a+4b)$. Since $f(x) > -2$ if and only if $1 < x < 2$, the curve must intersect the line $y=-2$ at $x=1$ and $x=2$.

Evaluating the function at these points, we get:

$$f(1) = -2$$
$$f(2) = -2$$

Solving the system of equations, we get:

$$a + 4b = -2$$
$$\ln 2 + 2a + 7b = -2$$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = -\frac{2}{3}$$

However, this is not the only possible value of $b$. Since the curve is centrally symmetric, we can reflect the curve about its center to get another curve that satisfies the condition.

Let's reflect the curve about its center $(1, a+4b)$. Substituting $x' = 2-x$ and $y' = 2a + 8b - y$, we get:

$$y' = 2a + 8b - \left(\ln \frac{x'}{2-x'} + ax' + bx'^3 - 3bx'^2 + 3bx' - b\right)$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$y' = \ln \frac{x'}{2-x'} + ax' + bx'^3 - 3bx'^2 + 3bx' - b$$

This is the same as the original curve. Therefore, the reflected curve also satisfies the condition.

The reflected curve intersects the line $y=-2$ at $x=1$ and $x=2$, so we get the same system of equations:

$$a + 4b = -2$$
$$\ln 2 + 2a + 7b = -2$$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = -\frac{2}{3}$$

However, this is not the only possible value of $b$. Since the curve is centrally symmetric, we can reflect the curve again to get another curve that satisfies the condition. Repeating this process, we get:

$$b = -\frac{2}{3} + 2n$$

where $n$ is an integer.

Therefore, the range of $b$ is:

$$\boxed{b \in \left\{-\frac{2}{3} + 2n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}}$$

Prompt: 设 $m$ 为正整数，数列 $a_1，a_2，\ldots，a_{4m+2}$ 是公差不为 0 的等差数列，若从中删去两项 $a_i$ 和 $a_j (i < j)$ 后剩余的 $4m$ 项可被平均分为 $m$ 组，且每组的 4 个数能构成等差数列，则称数列 $a_1，a_2，\ldots，a_{4m+2}$ 是 $(i，j)$-可分数列。(1) 写出所有的 $(i，j)，1 \leq i \leq j \leq 6$ ，使数列 $a_1，a_2，\ldots，a_6$ 是 $(i，j)$ -可分数列。(2) 当 $m \geq 3$ 时，证明：数列 $a_1，a_2，\ldots，a_{4m+2}$ 是 $(2，13)$ -可分数列。(3) 从 $1，2，\ldots，4m+2$ 中一次任取两个数 $i$ 和 $j (i < j)$ ，记数列 $a_1，a_2，\ldots，a_{4m+2}$ 是 $(i，j)$ -可分数列的概率为 $P_m$ ，证明 $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$ 。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) Find all $(i, j)$ such that $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6$ is an $(i, j)$-splittable sequence.**

Since there are 6 terms in the sequence, we need to remove 2 terms to get 4 terms that can be divided into 1 group of 4 terms. Let's analyze the possible cases:

* If we remove 2 consecutive terms, say $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$, the remaining 4 terms cannot be divided into 1 group of 4 terms with equal differences.
* If we remove 2 non-consecutive terms, say $a_i$ and $a_j$ ($i < j$), the remaining 4 terms can be divided into 1 group of 4 terms with equal differences if and only if $i$ and $j$ have the same parity (both even or both odd).

The possible pairs $(i, j)$ that satisfy this condition are:

$$(1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 6)$$

So, there are 6 possible $(i, j)$ pairs.

**(2) Prove that $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is a $(2, 13)$-splittable sequence when $m \geq 3$.**

Let's remove $a_2$ and $a_{13}$ from the sequence. The remaining 4m terms can be divided into $m$ groups of 4 terms each:

$$a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7; \quad a_4, a_6, a_8, a_{10}; \quad \ldots; \quad a_{4m-2}, a_{4m}, a_{4m+1}, a_{4m+2}$$

Each group has equal differences, so $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is a $(2, 13)$-splittable sequence.

**(3) Prove that $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$ when $m \geq 3$.**

There are ${4m+2 \choose 2} = \frac{(4m+2)(4m+1)}{2}$ possible pairs $(i, j)$.

From part (1), we know that there are at least 6 pairs $(i, j)$ that make $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ an $(i, j)$-splittable sequence. In fact, there are many more pairs that satisfy this condition.

Let's consider the pairs $(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ have the same parity. There are $2m+1$ even numbers and $2m+1$ odd numbers in the sequence. We can choose 1 even number and 1 odd number, or 2 even numbers, or 2 odd numbers. This gives us at least $(2m+1)^2 + (2m+1)^2 = 8m^2 + 8m + 2$ pairs $(i, j)$ that make $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ an $(i, j)$-splittable sequence.

Therefore, the probability $P_m$ is at least:

$$P_m \geq \frac{8m^2 + 8m + 2}{\frac{(4m+2)(4m+1)}{2}} = \frac{16m^2 + 16m + 4}{(4m+2)(4m+1)}$$

When $m \geq 3$, we have:

$$P_m \geq \frac{16m^2 + 16m + 4}{(4m+2)(4m+1)} > \frac{16m^2 + 16m + 4}{(4m+3)(4m+2)} = \frac{1}{8}$$

So, $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$ when $m \geq 3$.

The final answers are:

\boxed{(1) (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 6)}

\boxed{(2) True}

\boxed{(3) True}
