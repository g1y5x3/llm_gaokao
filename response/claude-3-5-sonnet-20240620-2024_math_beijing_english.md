Prompt: Given sets $M = \{x| -4 < x ≤ 1 \}$ and $N = \{x| -1 < x < 3 \}$, then $M \cup N =$ _____?
A. ${x|-4 < x < 3}$
B. ${x|-1 < x \leq 1}$
C. ${0,1,2}$
D. ${x|-1 < x < 4}$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what M and N represent:
   M = {x| -4 < x ≤ 1} means all x greater than -4 and less than or equal to 1
   N = {x| -1 < x < 3} means all x greater than -1 and less than 3

2) The union of M and N (M ∪ N) will include all elements that are in either M or N or both.

3) Let's consider the intervals:
   - M covers from just above -4 to 1 (including 1)
   - N covers from just above -1 to just below 3

4) When we combine these:
   - The lower bound will be from M: just above -4
   - The upper bound will be from N: just below 3

5) Therefore, M ∪ N will include all x that are:
   Greater than -4 (from M)
   AND
   Less than 3 (from N)

6) This can be written as: {x| -4 < x < 3}

7) Looking at our options, this matches choice A.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$\boxed{{x|-4 < x < 3}}$

Answer:A

#### 2
Prompt: Given $\frac{Z}{i} = i - 1$, what is $Z =$ _____?
A. $1-i$
B. $-i$
C. $-1-i$
D. $i$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We start with the equation: $\frac{Z}{i} = i - 1$

2) To solve for Z, we need to multiply both sides by i:
   $Z = i(i - 1)$

3) Let's expand the right side:
   $Z = i^2 - i$

4) Now, we need to remember a key property of i:
   $i^2 = -1$

5) Let's substitute this in:
   $Z = -1 - i$

6) This matches option C in the given choices.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{-1-i}$.

Answer:C

#### 3
Prompt: What is the distance from the center of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 6y = 0$ to the line $x - y + 2 = 0$ _____?
A. $2\sqrt{3}$
B. $2$
C. $3\sqrt{2}$
D. $\sqrt{6}$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the center of the circle. The general equation of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center.

2) Expanding our given equation: $x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 6y = 0$
   Rearranging: $(x^2 - 2x) + (y^2 + 6y) = 0$
   Completing the square: $(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = 1 + 9$
   $(x-1)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 10$

3) So, the center of the circle is (1, -3).

4) Now, we need to find the distance from this point to the line $x - y + 2 = 0$.

5) The formula for the distance d from a point (x0, y0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is:
   $d = \frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$

6) In our case, A = 1, B = -1, C = 2, x0 = 1, y0 = -3

7) Plugging these into the formula:
   $d = \frac{|1(1) + (-1)(-3) + 2|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}}$
   $= \frac{|1 + 3 + 2|}{\sqrt{2}}$
   $= \frac{6}{\sqrt{2}}$
   $= 3\sqrt{2}$

Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to the line is $3\sqrt{2}$.

The answer is $\boxed{C. 3\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer:C

#### 4
Prompt: What is the coefficient of $x^3$ in the binomial expansion of $(x - \sqrt{x})^4$?
A. 15
B. 6
C. -4
D. -13

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the binomial expansion formula:
   $(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$

2) In our case, $a = x$, $b = -\sqrt{x}$, and $n = 4$

3) We're looking for the coefficient of $x^3$, which means we need terms where the powers of $x$ add up to 3.

4) The relevant terms will be:
   - $x^3$ from $x^4$
   - $x^3$ from $x^3 (-\sqrt{x})$

5) Let's calculate these terms:

   a) From $x^4$: $\binom{4}{0} x^4 = 1 \cdot x^4$
      The $x^3$ coefficient here is 0.

   b) From $x^3 (-\sqrt{x})$: $\binom{4}{1} x^3 (-\sqrt{x}) = 4 \cdot x^3 \cdot (-\sqrt{x}) = -4x^{7/2}$
      The $x^3$ coefficient here is -4.

6) Adding these coefficients: 0 + (-4) = -4

Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion is -4.

The answer is $\boxed{-4}$, which corresponds to option C.

Answer:B

#### 5
Prompt: Given vectors $a$ and $b$, then "$(a + b)(a - b) = 0$" is a _____ condition for "$a = b$ or $a = -b$".
A. Necessary but not sufficient condition
B. Sufficient but not necessary condition
C. Necessary and sufficient condition
D. Neither sufficient nor necessary condition

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's expand $(a + b)(a - b)$:
   $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab + ba - b^2 = a^2 - b^2$

2) So, the equation $(a + b)(a - b) = 0$ is equivalent to $a^2 - b^2 = 0$

3) Now, let's consider the two parts of the statement:

   Part 1: If $(a + b)(a - b) = 0$, then $a = b$ or $a = -b$
   Part 2: If $a = b$ or $a = -b$, then $(a + b)(a - b) = 0$

4) Let's prove Part 1:
   If $a^2 - b^2 = 0$, then $a^2 = b^2$
   This means $a = b$ or $a = -b$

5) Let's prove Part 2:
   If $a = b$, then $a^2 - b^2 = b^2 - b^2 = 0$
   If $a = -b$, then $a^2 - b^2 = (-b)^2 - b^2 = b^2 - b^2 = 0$

6) Since both parts are true, the condition is both necessary and sufficient.

Therefore, the answer is:

$\boxed{\text{C. Necessary and sufficient condition}}$

Answer:A

#### 6
Prompt: Given $f(x) = sin \omega x$, $f(x_1) = -1$, $f(x_2) = 1$, $|x_1 - x_2|_{min} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $\omega =$ _____?
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, recall that the general form of a sine function is $\sin(\omega x)$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

2) We're given that $f(x_1) = -1$ and $f(x_2) = 1$. In a sine function, these values occur at the minimum and maximum points respectively.

3) The distance between a minimum and maximum point in a sine function is always $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians or 90°.

4) We're told that $|x_1 - x_2|_{min} = \frac{\pi}{2}$. This means that the minimum distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

5) In a standard sine function ($\sin x$), the distance between a minimum and maximum is $\frac{\pi}{2}$. But in our function $f(x) = \sin(\omega x)$, this distance is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

6) This means that $\omega$ is scaling the x-axis such that a distance of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in our function corresponds to a distance of $\pi$ in a standard sine function.

7) We can express this relationship as:

   $\omega \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi$

8) Solving for $\omega$:

   $\omega = \frac{\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2}} = 2$

Therefore, the value of $\omega$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The correct answer is B. 2.

Answer:B

#### 7
Prompt: The water quality is recorded as $d = \frac{S-1}{ln n}$, and the larger $d$ is, the better the water quality. If $S$ remains constant, and $d_1 = 2.1$, $d_2 = 2.2$, then what is the relationship between $n_1$ and $n_2$?
A. $n_1 < n_2$
B. $n_1 > n_2$
C. If $S < 1$, then $n_1 < n_2$; if $S > 1$, then $n_1 > n_2$;
D. If $S < 1$, then $n_1 > n_2$; if $S > 1$, then $n_1 < n_2$;

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $d = \frac{S-1}{ln n}$, where $S$ is constant for both cases.

2) We know that $d_1 = 2.1$ and $d_2 = 2.2$, and $d_2 > d_1$.

3) Let's write out the equations for both cases:

   $2.1 = \frac{S-1}{ln n_1}$
   $2.2 = \frac{S-1}{ln n_2}$

4) Since $S$ is constant, we can say that $(S-1)$ is also constant. Let's call this constant $k$. So:

   $2.1 = \frac{k}{ln n_1}$
   $2.2 = \frac{k}{ln n_2}$

5) Now, let's consider the relationship between these equations:

   $\frac{2.1}{2.2} = \frac{ln n_2}{ln n_1}$

6) We know that $\frac{2.1}{2.2} < 1$, so:

   $\frac{ln n_2}{ln n_1} < 1$

7) This means that $ln n_2 < ln n_1$

8) Since the natural logarithm function is strictly increasing, if $ln n_2 < ln n_1$, then $n_2 < n_1$

9) Therefore, $n_1 > n_2$

This reasoning holds regardless of the value of $S$, as long as it remains constant.

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{B. n_1 > n_2}$

Answer:C

#### 8
Prompt: Given a square pyramid with a base side length of 4, and four lateral edges of lengths $4,4,2\sqrt{2},2\sqrt{2}$, what is the height of this pyramid?
A. $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
B. $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
C. $2\sqrt{3}$
D. $\sqrt{3}$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's visualize the pyramid. It has a square base with side length 4, and four lateral edges, two of which are 4 and two are 2√2.

2) The fact that two edges are shorter than the others suggests that the apex of the pyramid is not directly above the center of the base, but offset towards one side.

3) Let's consider the triangle formed by half of the base diagonal, the height of the pyramid, and one of the 2√2 edges.

4) Half of the base diagonal in a square with side 4 is 2√2.

5) Now we have a right-angled triangle with:
   - Hypotenuse = 2√2 (one of the shorter lateral edges)
   - Base = 2√2 (half of the base diagonal)
   - Height = h (the height we're looking for)

6) We can use the Pythagorean theorem:
   h² + (2√2)² = (2√2)²

7) Simplify:
   h² + 8 = 8

8) Subtract 8 from both sides:
   h² = 0

9) Take the square root of both sides:
   h = 0

However, this result doesn't make sense for a pyramid. The problem lies in our assumption that the height forms a right angle with the base. In fact, the height must be perpendicular to the base plane, not to the base diagonal.

10) Let's consider the triangle formed by the height, half a side of the base (2), and one of the longer lateral edges (4).

11) Now we have a right-angled triangle with:
    - Hypotenuse = 4
    - Base = 2
    - Height = h

12) Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
    h² + 2² = 4²

13) Simplify:
    h² + 4 = 16

14) Subtract 4 from both sides:
    h² = 12

15) Take the square root of both sides:
    h = √12 = 2√3

Therefore, the height of the pyramid is $\boxed{2\sqrt{3}}$.

The correct answer is C. $2\sqrt{3}$

Answer:D

#### 9
Prompt: Given that $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are points on the curve $y=2^x$, which of the following is correct:
A. $\log_2 \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} > \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}$
B. $\log_2 \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} < \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}$
C. $\log_2 \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} > x_1+x_2$
D. $\log_2 \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} < x_1+x_2$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) Given that $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are points on the curve $y=2^x$, we can write:
   $y_1 = 2^{x_1}$ and $y_2 = 2^{x_2}$

2) Now, let's consider the expression $\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}$:
   $\frac{y_1+y_2}{2} = \frac{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}}{2}$

3) We know from the properties of exponential functions that:
   $2^{\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}} < \frac{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}}{2}$
   This is because the exponential function is strictly convex.

4) Taking $\log_2$ of both sides (note that $\log_2$ is a strictly increasing function, so it preserves the inequality):
   $\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} < \log_2(\frac{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}}{2}) = \log_2(\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$

5) This directly contradicts option B and confirms option A.

6) To address options C and D, note that:
   $\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} < x_1+x_2$ (for any non-equal real numbers)

7) Combining this with the inequality from step 4:
   $\log_2(\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}) > \frac{x_1+x_2}{2} > x_1+x_2$

8) This contradicts option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

$\boxed{A. \log_2 \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} > \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}}$

Answer:A

#### 10
Prompt: If the set $\{ y|y=x+t(x^2-x), 0≤t≤1, 1≤x≤2 \}$ represents a graph, where the maximum distance between two points is $d$, and the area is $S$, then:
A. $d=3, S<1$
B. $d=3, S>1$
C. $d=\sqrt{10}, S<1$
D. $d=\sqrt{10}, S>1$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what the set represents. It's a family of curves parameterized by t, where t ranges from 0 to 1, and x ranges from 1 to 2.

2) When t = 0, y = x, which is a straight line from (1,1) to (2,2).
   When t = 1, y = x^2, which is a parabola from (1,1) to (2,4).

3) So, this set represents the area between the line y = x and the parabola y = x^2 for 1 ≤ x ≤ 2.

4) To find the maximum distance d, we need to find the distance between the two farthest points. These would be (1,1) and (2,4).

   d = √[(2-1)^2 + (4-1)^2] = √(1 + 9) = √10

5) For the area S, we need to integrate the difference between x^2 and x from 1 to 2:

   S = ∫[1 to 2] (x^2 - x) dx
     = [x^3/3 - x^2/2]|[1 to 2]
     = (8/3 - 2) - (1/3 - 1/2)
     = 2/3 - 1/6
     = 1/2
     = 0.5

6) Therefore, S < 1

Comparing with the given options:
A. Incorrect: d ≠ 3
B. Incorrect: d ≠ 3
C. Correct: d = √10 and S < 1
D. Incorrect: S is not > 1

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{C}$.

Answer:C

#### 11
Prompt: Given the parabola $y^2 = 16x$, what are the coordinates of the focus?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The general form of a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry is:
   $x = a(y-k)^2 + h$
   where (h,k) is the vertex and a determines the direction and width of the parabola.

2) Our parabola is given as $y^2 = 16x$. We need to rearrange this to match the general form:
   $x = \frac{1}{16}y^2$

3) Comparing this to the general form, we can see that:
   $a = \frac{1}{16}$
   $k = 0$
   $h = 0$

4) The vertex of this parabola is therefore at (0,0).

5) For a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry, the focus is located $\frac{1}{4a}$ units to the right of the vertex.

6) In this case, $\frac{1}{4a} = \frac{1}{4(\frac{1}{16})} = 4$

7) Therefore, the focus is 4 units to the right of the vertex (0,0).

8) The coordinates of the focus are (4,0).

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{(4,0)}$.

Answer:(4,0)

#### 12
Prompt: Given that $\alpha ∈ [π/6,π/3]$, and the terminal sides of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are symmetric about the origin, what is the maximum value of $cos \beta$?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to understand what it means for the terminal sides of α and β to be symmetric about the origin. This implies that β = α + π.

2) We know that cos(x + π) = -cos(x) for any angle x. Therefore, cos β = -cos α.

3) Given that α ∈ [π/6, π/3], we need to find the maximum value of -cos α within this range.

4) The cosine function is decreasing in the interval [0, π], which includes our range [π/6, π/3].

5) Therefore, the maximum value of -cos α will occur when cos α is at its minimum in the given range.

6) In [π/6, π/3], cos α is minimum when α = π/3.

7) So, the maximum value of cos β will be:
   max(cos β) = -cos(π/3) = -(1/2) = -0.5

Therefore, the maximum value of cos β is $\boxed{-0.5}$.

Answer:$-\frac{1}{2}$

#### 13
Prompt: Given the hyperbola $x^2/4 - y^2 = 1$, what is the slope of the line passing through (3,0) and having only one intersection point with the hyperbola?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The given hyperbola equation is $x^2/4 - y^2 = 1$

2) The line we're looking for is tangent to the hyperbola. Let's call its equation $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope we're trying to find.

3) Since the line passes through (3,0), we can say:
   0 = 3m + b
   b = -3m

4) So our line equation is $y = mx - 3m$ or $y = m(x-3)$

5) To find where this line intersects the hyperbola, we substitute this y into the hyperbola equation:

   $x^2/4 - (m(x-3))^2 = 1$

6) Expand this:
   $x^2/4 - (m^2x^2 - 6m^2x + 9m^2) = 1$

7) Rearrange:
   $x^2/4 - m^2x^2 + 6m^2x - 9m^2 - 1 = 0$

8) Collect like terms:
   $(1/4 - m^2)x^2 + 6m^2x - (9m^2 + 1) = 0$

9) For this to be a tangent line, this quadratic should have exactly one solution. This happens when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $b^2 - 4ac$.

10) In our case:
    $a = 1/4 - m^2$
    $b = 6m^2$
    $c = -(9m^2 + 1)$

11) Set the discriminant to zero:
    $(6m^2)^2 - 4(1/4 - m^2)(-(9m^2 + 1)) = 0$

12) Expand:
    $36m^4 - (9m^2 + 1 - 36m^4 - 4m^2) = 0$
    $72m^4 - 13m^2 - 1 = 0$

13) This is a quadratic in $m^2$. Solve it:
    $m^2 = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{169 + 288}}{144} = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{457}}{144}$

14) We want the positive solution:
    $m^2 = \frac{13 + \sqrt{457}}{144}$

15) Take the square root:
    $m = \pm \sqrt{\frac{13 + \sqrt{457}}{144}}$

16) The positive value is the slope of the upward-sloping tangent line, and the negative is the slope of the downward-sloping tangent line. Since we're asked for just one slope, let's take the positive one.

Therefore, the slope is $\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{13 + \sqrt{457}}{144}}}$

Answer:$\pm \frac{1}{2}$

#### 14
Prompt: Given that the volumes of three cylinders form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 10, the diameter of the first cylinder is 65mm, the diameters of the second and third cylinders are 325mm, and the height of the third cylinder is 230mm, what are the heights of the first two cylinders respectively?

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1) Let's denote the heights of the three cylinders as h₁, h₂, and h₃, and their radii as r₁, r₂, and r₃.

2) We know that the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h.

3) Given that the volumes form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 10, we can write:
   V₂ = 10V₁ and V₃ = 10V₂ = 100V₁

4) We're given the following information:
   - Diameter of first cylinder = 65mm, so r₁ = 32.5mm
   - Diameter of second and third cylinders = 325mm, so r₂ = r₃ = 162.5mm
   - Height of third cylinder, h₃ = 230mm

5) Let's write out the volume equations:
   V₁ = πr₁²h₁ = π(32.5)²h₁
   V₂ = πr₂²h₂ = π(162.5)²h₂
   V₃ = πr₃²h₃ = π(162.5)²(230)

6) Now, let's use the geometric sequence relationship:
   π(162.5)²h₂ = 10π(32.5)²h₁
   π(162.5)²(230) = 100π(32.5)²h₁

7) From the second equation:
   h₁ = π(162.5)²(230) / (100π(32.5)²) = 230

8) Now we can find h₂ using the first equation:
   (162.5)²h₂ = 10(32.5)²(230)
   h₂ = 10(32.5)²(230) / (162.5)² = 46

Therefore, the heights of the first and second cylinders are:

$\boxed{h₁ = 230mm, h₂ = 46mm}$

Answer:57.5mm, 23mm

#### 15
Prompt: Given that $M = {a_n = b_n}$, where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are not constant sequences and are different from each other, which of the following is correct _____?
(1) If $a_n$ and $b_n$ are both arithmetic sequences, then M contains at most one element;
(2) If $a_n$ and $b_n$ are both geometric sequences, then M contains at most three elements;
(3) If $a_n$ is an arithmetic sequence and $b_n$ is a geometric sequence, then M contains at most three elements;
(4) If $a_n$ is monotonically increasing and $b_n$ is monotonically decreasing, then M contains at most one element.

Response:

Let's analyze each statement one by one:

1) If $a_n$ and $b_n$ are both arithmetic sequences:
   Let $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d_1$ and $b_n = b_1 + (n-1)d_2$, where $d_1 \neq d_2$ (as they are different sequences).
   Equating: $a_1 + (n-1)d_1 = b_1 + (n-1)d_2$
   $(a_1 - b_1) = (d_2 - d_1)(n-1)$
   This is a linear equation in n, which has at most one solution. So this statement is correct.

2) If $a_n$ and $b_n$ are both geometric sequences:
   Let $a_n = ar^{n-1}$ and $b_n = bs^{n-1}$, where $r \neq s$ (as they are different sequences).
   Equating: $ar^{n-1} = bs^{n-1}$
   $(\frac{a}{b}) = (\frac{s}{r})^{n-1}$
   Taking log: $\log(\frac{a}{b}) = (n-1)\log(\frac{s}{r})$
   This is a linear equation in n, which has at most one solution. So this statement is incorrect.

3) If $a_n$ is arithmetic and $b_n$ is geometric:
   Let $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ and $b_n = br^{n-1}$
   Equating: $a + (n-1)d = br^{n-1}$
   This is an exponential equation, which can have more than three solutions. So this statement is incorrect.

4) If $a_n$ is monotonically increasing and $b_n$ is monotonically decreasing:
   As $a_n$ is always increasing and $b_n$ is always decreasing, they can intersect at most once. So this statement is correct.

Therefore, the correct statements are (1) and (4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1) \text{ and } (4)}$

Prompt: In △ABC, a = 7, A is an obtuse angle, and $\sin 2B = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} b \cos B$.
(1) Find ∠A;
(2) Choose one condition from condition ①, condition ②, and condition ③ as given, and calculate the area of △ABC.
① b = 7; ② $\cos B = \frac{13}{14}$; ③ $c \sin A = \frac{5}{2}\sqrt{3}$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step by step:

(1) Finding ∠A:

Given that A is an obtuse angle and a = 7, we can use the sine law for the given equation:

$\sin 2B = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} b \cos B$

The sine double angle formula states: $\sin 2B = 2\sin B \cos B$

Therefore, $2\sin B \cos B = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} b \cos B$

Simplifying: $2\sin B = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} b$

Now, using the sine law: $\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b}$

Substituting known values: $\frac{\sin A}{7} = \frac{\sin B}{b}$

$\sin A = 7 \cdot \frac{\sin B}{b} = 7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{14} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

Therefore, $A = \arcsin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 150°$

(2) Calculating the area of △ABC:

Let's use condition ② where $\cos B = \frac{13}{14}$

We can find $\sin B$ using the Pythagorean identity:
$\sin^2 B + \cos^2 B = 1$
$\sin^2 B = 1 - (\frac{13}{14})^2 = \frac{51}{196}$
$\sin B = \frac{\sqrt{51}}{14}$

Now we can use the sine law to find b:
$\frac{b}{\sin A} = \frac{7}{\sin B}$

$b = \frac{7 \sin A}{\sin B} = \frac{7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{51}}{14}} = \frac{49\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{51}}$

The area of a triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$

We can find $\sin C$ using: $\sin C = \sin(180° - A - B) = \sin(30° - B)$

$\sin(30° - B) = \sin 30° \cos B - \cos 30° \sin B = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{13}{14} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{51}}{14} = \frac{13-3\sqrt{17}}{28}$

Therefore, the area is:

$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{49\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{51}} \cdot \frac{13-3\sqrt{17}}{28}$

Simplifying: $Area = \frac{343\sqrt{3}(13-3\sqrt{17})}{56\sqrt{51}}$

Therefore, the final answers are:

(1) $\boxed{A = 150°}$
(2) $\boxed{Area = \frac{343\sqrt{3}(13-3\sqrt{17})}{56\sqrt{51}}}$

Answer:(1) $A=\frac{2\pi}{3}$ (2) $S=\frac{15\sqrt{3}}{4}$

Prompt: Given a quadrilateral pyramid P-ABCD, AD//BC, AB = BC = 1, AD = 3, DE = PE = 2, E is a point on AD, PE ⊥ AD.
(1) If F is the midpoint of PE, prove that: BF // plane PCD.
(2) If AB ⊥ plane PED, find the cosine value of the angle between face PAB and face PCD.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) To prove that BF // plane PCD:

Step 1: Since F is the midpoint of PE and PE ⊥ AD, F is equidistant from P and E.

Step 2: As AD // BC and E is on AD, the plane PED is parallel to BC.

Step 3: Since F is equidistant from P and E, and PED // BC, F must also be equidistant from B and C.

Step 4: The line BF intersects the plane PCD at point F, which is equidistant from P, C, and D.

Step 5: Therefore, BF is parallel to the plane PCD.

(2) To find the cosine value of the angle between face PAB and face PCD:

Step 1: Let's denote the angle between these faces as θ.

Step 2: Given that AB ⊥ plane PED, AB is perpendicular to both PE and AD.

Step 3: In the right triangle PAB:
   cos θ = PB / PA

Step 4: We need to find PB and PA.

Step 5: In the right triangle PDE:
   PD² = PE² + DE² = 2² + 2² = 8
   PD = 2√2

Step 6: In the right triangle PAD:
   PA² = PD² + AD² = 8 + 9 = 17
   PA = √17

Step 7: In the right triangle PAB:
   PB² = PA² - AB² = 17 - 1 = 16
   PB = 4

Step 8: Now we can calculate cos θ:
   cos θ = PB / PA = 4 / √17

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\cos θ = \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}}$

Answer:(1) skipped (2) $\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{30}$

#### 18
Prompt: Given that the premium for a certain type of insurance is 0.4 million yuan, the first 3 claims are 0.8 million yuan each, and the 4th claim is 0.6 million yuan.
Number of claims | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
Number of policies | 800 | 100 | 60 | 30 | 10 |
In a sample of 100 policies from the population, using frequency to estimate probability:
(1) Calculate the probability of randomly selecting a policy with fewer than 2 claims;
(2) (i) Gross profit is the difference between premium and claim amount. Let X be the gross profit, estimate the expected value of X;
(ii) If the premium for policies without claims decreases by 4% in the next insurance period, and increases by 20% for policies with claims, estimate the expected value of gross profit for policies in the next insurance period.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of policies:
   800 + 100 + 60 + 30 + 10 = 1000 policies in total

(1) Probability of selecting a policy with fewer than 2 claims:

   Policies with 0 or 1 claim: 800 + 100 = 900
   Probability = 900 / 1000 = 0.9

   $\boxed{P(\text{fewer than 2 claims}) = 0.9}$

(2) (i) Expected value of gross profit X:

   Let's calculate the expected claim amount first:
   E(claim) = (0.8 * 0.1 + 1.6 * 0.06 + 2.4 * 0.03 + 3.0 * 0.01) = 0.33 million yuan

   E(X) = Premium - E(claim) = 0.4 - 0.33 = 0.07 million yuan

   $\boxed{E(X) = 0.07 \text{ million yuan}}$

(2) (ii) Expected value of gross profit for the next period:

   New premium for policies without claims: 0.4 * 0.96 = 0.384 million yuan
   New premium for policies with claims: 0.4 * 1.2 = 0.48 million yuan

   New expected premium:
   E(new premium) = 0.384 * 0.8 + 0.48 * 0.2 = 0.3072 + 0.096 = 0.4032 million yuan

   The expected claim amount remains the same: 0.33 million yuan

   New E(X) = 0.4032 - 0.33 = 0.0732 million yuan

   $\boxed{\text{New }E(X) = 0.0732 \text{ million yuan}}$

Answer:(1) $\frac{1}{70}$ (2)(i) 0.122 (2)(ii) 0.1252

Prompt: Given the ellipse equation $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1(a > b > 0)$, the foci and the endpoints of the minor axis form a square with side length 2. A line $l$ passing through $(0,t)(t > \sqrt{2})$ intersects the ellipse at points $A$, $B$, and $C(0,1)$. The line $AC$ intersects the ellipse at point $D$.
(1) Find the ellipse equation and its eccentricity;
(2) If the slope of line $BD$ is 0, find $t$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1) First, let's find the ellipse equation:

   - The foci and endpoints of the minor axis form a square with side length 2.
   - The distance between the foci is 2, so c = 1 (half of the side length).
   - The minor axis is also 2, so b = 1.

   We can use the relation: a² = b² + c²
   a² = 1² + 1² = 2
   a = √2

   So, the ellipse equation is: $\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1$

2) The eccentricity e is given by e = c/a:
   e = 1/√2 = √2/2

3) Now, for the second part, we need to find t when the slope of BD is 0.

4) The line l passes through (0,t) and (0,1), so its equation is x = 0.

5) Point C is (0,1), which satisfies the ellipse equation.

6) For point D, we need to find the intersection of AC with the ellipse.

7) The slope of AC is (1-t)/(0-0) which is undefined. This means AC is vertical and has the equation x = 0.

8) So, D is also (0,1), the same as C.

9) For BD to have a slope of 0, B must have the same y-coordinate as D, which is 1.

10) We can find the x-coordinate of B by substituting y=1 into the ellipse equation:

    $\frac{x^2}{2} + 1^2 = 1$
    $x^2 = 2(1-1) = 0$
    $x = 0$

11) So, B is also (0,1).

12) For this to be true, the line l must be tangent to the ellipse at (0,1).

13) The slope of the tangent line at (0,1) should be perpendicular to the radius at that point.

14) The slope of the radius at (0,1) is 0/1 = 0.

15) So, the tangent line should have an undefined slope, which means it's vertical.

16) This confirms that l is indeed the vertical line x = 0.

17) For l to pass through (0,t), t can be any value greater than 1.

Therefore, the final answers are:

(1) Ellipse equation: $\boxed{\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}$, Eccentricity: $\boxed{e = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$

(2) $\boxed{t \text{ can be any value greater than } \sqrt{2}}$

Answer:(1) $\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{2} = 1$ , $e = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ (2) $t=2$

Prompt: Given that $f(x)=x+k\ln(1+x)$ has a tangent line $l$ at the point $(t,f(t))(t>0)$.
(1) If the slope of the tangent line $l$ is $k=-1$, find the monotonic intervals of $f(x)$;
(2) Prove that the tangent line $l$ does not pass through $(0,0)$;
(3) Given $A(t,f(t))$, $C(0,f(t))$, $O(0,0)$, where $t>0$, and the tangent line $l$ intersects the $y$-axis at point $B$. When $2^{\omega O}=15\delta_{ABO}$, how many points $A$ satisfy this condition?
(Reference data: $1.09<\ln3<1.10$, $1.60<\ln5<1.61$, $1.94<\ln7<1.95$)

Response:

Let's approach this problem step by step:

(1) To find the monotonic intervals of f(x):

First, let's find f'(x):
f'(x) = 1 + k/(1+x)

Given that the slope of the tangent line at (t,f(t)) is -1, we can write:
1 + k/(1+t) = -1

Solving for k:
k = -2(1+t)

Now, let's substitute this back into f'(x):
f'(x) = 1 - 2(1+t)/(1+x)

For f(x) to be increasing, we need f'(x) > 0:
1 - 2(1+t)/(1+x) > 0
(1+x) - 2(1+t) > 0
x - 2t - 1 > 0
x > 2t + 1

Therefore, f(x) is decreasing on (0, 2t+1) and increasing on (2t+1, ∞).

(2) To prove that the tangent line l does not pass through (0,0):

The equation of the tangent line is:
y - f(t) = -1(x - t)

If this line passed through (0,0), we would have:
0 - f(t) = -1(0 - t)
f(t) = t

But f(t) = t + k ln(1+t) = t - 2(1+t)ln(1+t)
For these to be equal:
t - 2(1+t)ln(1+t) = t
-2(1+t)ln(1+t) = 0

This is only true if t = 0, which contradicts our given condition that t > 0.
Therefore, the tangent line does not pass through (0,0).

(3) For the final part:

We know that ∠ABO = 45° (since the slope of AB is -1).
Given that 2^∠ABO = 15∠ABO, we can write:
2^(π/4) = 15(π/4)
2^(π/4) = (15π)/4

Taking ln of both sides:
(π/4)ln2 = ln((15π)/4)
π = 4[ln(15π) - ln4]/ln2

Using the given reference data, we can approximate:
π ≈ 4[ln15 + ln(π) - ln4]/ln2
   ≈ 4[2.71 + 1.15 - 1.39]/0.69
   ≈ 14.2

This is very close to the actual value of π (≈ 3.14159), suggesting that there is only one solution.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Answer:(1) $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on $(-1,0)$ and monotonically increasing on $(0,+\infty)$ (2) skip (3) 2

Prompt: Let set $M=\{(i,j,s,t)|i\in\{1,2\},j\in\{3,4\},s\in\{5,6\},t\in\{7,8\},2|(i+j+s+t)\}$. For a given ordered sequence $A:\{a_n\}(1\leq n\leq 8)$, and sequence $\Omega:\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\omega_s$, where $\omega_k=(i_k,j_k,s_k,t_k)\in M$, define transformation $T$: add 1 to the $i_1,j_1,s_1,t_1$ terms of sequence $A$ to obtain sequence $T_1(A)$; add 1 to the $i_2,j_2,s_2,t_2$ terms of sequence $T_1(A)$ to obtain sequence $T_2T_1(A)$...; repeat the above operation to obtain sequence $T_s ... T_2T_1(A)$, denoted as $\Omega(A)$.
(1) Given sequence $A:1,3,2,4,6,3,1,9$ and sequence $\Omega:(1,3,5,7),(2,4,6,8),(1,3,5,7)$, write out $\Omega(A)$;
(2) Is there a sequence $\Omega$ that makes $\Omega(A)$ equal to $a_1+2,a_2+2,a_3+6,a_4+4,a_5+2,a_6+8,a_7+2,a_8+4,a_9+4$? If it exists, write out a $\Omega$ that meets the conditions; if it doesn't exist, please explain why;
(3) If all terms in sequence $A$ are positive integers, and $a_1+a_2+a_3$ is even, prove that: there exists a sequence $\Omega$ such that the elements of $\Omega(A)$ satisfy the condition $a'_1+a'_2=a'_3+a'_4=a'_5+a'_6=a'_7+a'_8$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) Given A: 1,3,2,4,6,3,1,9 and Ω: (1,3,5,7), (2,4,6,8), (1,3,5,7)

Step 1: Apply (1,3,5,7)
T₁(A): 2,4,2,4,7,3,2,9

Step 2: Apply (2,4,6,8)
T₂T₁(A): 2,5,2,5,7,4,2,10

Step 3: Apply (1,3,5,7)
T₃T₂T₁(A): 3,6,2,5,8,4,3,10

Therefore, Ω(A) = 3,6,2,5,8,4,3,10

(2) We need to find Ω that makes Ω(A) = a₁+2,a₂+2,a₃+6,a₄+4,a₅+2,a₆+8,a₇+2,a₈+4

Let's consider the differences:
2,2,6,4,2,8,2,4

We can achieve this with the following sequence:
Ω: (1,2,3,4), (3,4,5,6), (3,6,7,8)

Verification:
(1,2,3,4) adds 1 to all terms
(3,4,5,6) adds 1 to 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th terms
(3,6,7,8) adds 1 to 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th terms

This sequence Ω satisfies the condition.

(3) Proof:
Given: A is a sequence of positive integers and a₁+a₂+a₃ is even.

Step 1: Since a₁+a₂+a₃ is even, a₄+a₅+a₆+a₇+a₈ must be even for the sum of all terms to be even.

Step 2: We can construct Ω as follows:
- If a₁+a₂ < a₃+a₄, add (1,2,5,6) to Ω until a₁+a₂ = a₃+a₄
- If a₁+a₂ > a₃+a₄, add (3,4,5,6) to Ω until a₁+a₂ = a₃+a₄
- Repeat similar steps to equalize a₅+a₆ and a₇+a₈ with a₁+a₂

Step 3: After these operations, we have a'₁+a'₂ = a'₃+a'₄ = a'₅+a'₆ = a'₇+a'₈

Step 4: If the sum of all terms is odd at this point, we can add (1,3,5,7) to Ω to make it even.

Therefore, there always exists a sequence Ω that satisfies the condition.

The final answers are:

$\boxed{
\text{(1) Ω(A) = 3,6,2,5,8,4,3,10}
}$

$\boxed{
\text{(2) Ω: (1,2,3,4), (3,4,5,6), (3,6,7,8)}
}$

$\boxed{
\text{(3) Proof as outlined above}
}$
