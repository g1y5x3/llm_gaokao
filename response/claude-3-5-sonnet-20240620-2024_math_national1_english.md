Prompt: Given set $A = \{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$, $B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$, then $A \cap B =$ ?
A. $\{-1, 0\}$
B. $\{2, 3\}$
C. $\{-3, -1, 0\}$
D. $\{-1, 0, 2\}$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to understand what set A represents. It's all real numbers x where -5 < x^3 < 5.

2) Now, let's check each element of set B to see if it satisfies this condition:

   For -3: (-3)^3 = -27, which is less than -5, so -3 is not in A.
   For -1: (-1)^3 = -1, which is between -5 and 5, so -1 is in A.
   For 0: 0^3 = 0, which is between -5 and 5, so 0 is in A.
   For 2: 2^3 = 8, which is greater than 5, so 2 is not in A.
   For 3: 3^3 = 27, which is greater than 5, so 3 is not in A.

3) The intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) will contain only the elements that are in both A and B.

4) From our analysis in step 2, we can see that only -1 and 0 are in both A and B.

Therefore, A ∩ B = {-1, 0}

The answer is $\boxed{A. \{-1, 0\}}$

Answer:A

#### 2
Prompt: If $\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$, then $z =$ ?
A. $-1 - i$
B. $-1 + i$
C. $1 - i$
D. $1 + i$

Response:

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We start with the equation: $\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$

2) Let's multiply both sides by $(z-1)$:
   $z = (1+i)(z-1)$

3) Expand the right side:
   $z = z + iz - 1 - i$

4) Subtract $z$ from both sides:
   $0 = iz - 1 - i$

5) Add 1 and $i$ to both sides:
   $1 + i = iz$

6) Divide both sides by $i$:
   $\frac{1+i}{i} = z$

7) To simplify $\frac{1+i}{i}$, multiply numerator and denominator by $-i$:
   $\frac{(1+i)(-i)}{i(-i)} = \frac{i-1}{1} = i-1$

8) Therefore, $z = i-1$

9) We can write this in the form $a+bi$:
   $z = -1 + i$

Comparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches option B.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{-1 + i}$.

Answer:C

#### 3
Prompt: Given vectors $a = (0,1)$ and $b = (2,x)$. If $b ⊥ (b - 4a)$, then $x =$ ?
A. -2
B. -1
C. 1
D. 2

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to understand what $b ⊥ (b - 4a)$ means. This indicates that $b$ is perpendicular to $(b - 4a)$, which means their dot product should be zero.

2) Let's write out $b$ and $(b - 4a)$:
   $b = (2, x)$
   $b - 4a = (2, x) - 4(0, 1) = (2, x-4)$

3) For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:
   $b \cdot (b - 4a) = 0$

4) Let's calculate this dot product:
   $(2, x) \cdot (2, x-4) = 0$
   $2(2) + x(x-4) = 0$

5) Simplify:
   $4 + x^2 - 4x = 0$

6) Rearrange:
   $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$

7) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula or by factoring.
   Factoring: $(x - 2)(x - 2) = 0$

8) Solving this equation:
   $x - 2 = 0$
   $x = 2$

Therefore, the value of $x$ is 2.

The final answer is $\boxed{D. 2}$

Answer:D

#### 4
Prompt: Given $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$ and $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$, what is $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$?
A. $-3m$
B. $\frac{m}{3}$
C. $\frac{m}{3}$
D. $3m$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$ and $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$

2) We need to find $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$

3) Recall the cosine difference formula:
   $\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta$

4) Also recall the cosine sum formula:
   $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta$

5) Adding these two equations:
   $\cos(\alpha + \beta) + \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta$

6) Substituting the given information:
   $m + \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta$

7) Now, we need to find a way to express $\cos \alpha \cos \beta$ in terms of the given information.

8) We know that $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$. Let's use the identity:
   $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\cos \alpha \cos \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta}$

9) Substituting our known values:
   $m = \frac{\cos \alpha \cos \beta}{1 + 2} = \frac{\cos \alpha \cos \beta}{3}$

10) Therefore, $\cos \alpha \cos \beta = 3m$

11) Going back to the equation from step 6:
    $m + \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 2(3m)$

12) Simplifying:
    $m + \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 6m$

13) Solving for $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$:
    $\cos(\alpha - \beta) = 6m - m = 5m$

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{5m}$, which is not among the given options. The closest option is D. $3m$, but it's not exactly correct.

Answer:A

#### 5
Prompt: Given that a cylinder and a cone have equal base radii, equal lateral surface areas, and both have a height of $\sqrt{3}$, what is the volume of the cone?
A. $2\sqrt{3}\pi$
B. $3\sqrt{3}\pi$
C. $6\sqrt{3}\pi$
D. $9\sqrt{3}\pi$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) Let the radius of the base be r for both the cylinder and cone.

2) The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by 2πrh, where h is the height.
   The lateral surface area of a cone is given by πrs, where s is the slant height.

3) Given that these are equal and the heights are the same:
   2πr√3 = πrs

4) Simplify: 2r√3 = rs

5) For a cone, we know that r² + h² = s², where h is the height.
   r² + (√3)² = s²
   r² + 3 = s²

6) From step 4: s = 2√3
   Substituting this in the equation from step 5:
   r² + 3 = (2√3)²
   r² + 3 = 12
   r² = 9
   r = 3

7) Now that we know r and h, we can calculate the volume of the cone:
   Volume of cone = (1/3)πr²h
                  = (1/3)π(3²)(√3)
                  = (1/3)π(9)(√3)
                  = 3π√3

8) Simplify: 3π√3 = 3√3π

Therefore, the volume of the cone is $\boxed{3\sqrt{3}\pi}$.

The correct answer is B.

Answer:B

#### 6
Prompt: Given the function $f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 - 2ax - a, & x < 0 \\ e^x + \ln(x+1), & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$ is monotonically increasing on $R$, what is the range of values for $a$?
A. $(-\infty, 0]$
B. $[-1, 0]$
C. $[-1, 1]$
D. $[0, +\infty)$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For a function to be monotonically increasing, its derivative must be non-negative for all x.

2) Let's consider the two parts of the function separately:

   For x < 0: f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a
   For x ≥ 0: f(x) = e^x + ln(x+1)

3) For x ≥ 0, the derivative is always positive:
   f'(x) = e^x + 1/(x+1) > 0 for all x ≥ 0

4) For x < 0, let's find the derivative:
   f'(x) = -2x - 2a

5) For the function to be monotonically increasing, we need:
   -2x - 2a ≥ 0 for all x < 0

6) Rearranging this inequality:
   -2x ≥ 2a
   x ≤ -a

7) Since this needs to be true for all x < 0, the most restrictive condition is:
   0 ≤ -a
   a ≤ 0

8) Now, we also need the function to be continuous at x = 0 for it to be monotonically increasing over all R. Let's equate the two parts of the function at x = 0:

   -0^2 - 2a(0) - a = e^0 + ln(0+1)
   -a = 1 + 0
   a = -1

9) Therefore, a must be less than or equal to 0, and greater than or equal to -1.

Thus, the range of values for a is [-1, 0].

The correct answer is B. $\boxed{[-1, 0]}$

Answer:B

#### 7
Prompt: When $x \in [0, 2\pi]$, how many intersection points are there between the curves $y = \sin x$ and $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$?
A. 3
B. 4
C. 6
D. 8

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The intersection points occur when $\sin x = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$

2) This is a transcendental equation and can't be solved algebraically. However, we can reason about its solutions.

3) Let's consider the properties of these functions:
   - $\sin x$ has a period of $2\pi$
   - $2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ has a period of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$

4) In the interval $[0, 2\pi]$, $\sin x$ completes one full cycle.

5) In the same interval, $2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ completes 3 full cycles.

6) The amplitude of $\sin x$ is 1, while the amplitude of $2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ is 2.

7) Due to the difference in amplitudes and frequencies, we can expect these curves to intersect multiple times.

8) At $x = 0$, $\sin 0 = 0$ and $2\sin(-\frac{\pi}{6}) = -1$, so they don't intersect at the start.

9) At $x = 2\pi$, $\sin 2\pi = 0$ and $2\sin(6\pi - \frac{\pi}{6}) = -1$, so they don't intersect at the end.

10) Given that $2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ completes 3 full cycles, and considering the amplitude differences, we can expect the curves to intersect twice in each cycle of $2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$.

11) Therefore, we can expect 6 intersection points in total.

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{C. 6}$

Answer:C

#### 8
Prompt: Given that the domain of function $f(x)$ is $R$, $f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$, and when $x < 3$, $f(x) = x$, which of the following conclusions is definitely correct?
A. $f(10) > 100$
B. $f(20) > 1000$
C. $f(10) < 1000$
D. $f(20) < 10000$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We know that for x < 3, f(x) = x. So:
   f(1) = 1
   f(2) = 2

2) For x ≥ 3, we have the inequality: f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)

3) Let's calculate some values:
   f(3) > f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
   f(4) > f(3) + f(2) > 3 + 2 = 5
   f(5) > f(4) + f(3) > 5 + 3 = 8

4) We can see that this sequence is growing faster than the Fibonacci sequence.

5) The Fibonacci sequence goes: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, ...

6) Since our sequence grows faster than Fibonacci, we can say:
   f(10) > 55
   f(20) > 6765

7) This immediately rules out option A (f(10) > 100), as we can't be certain of this.

8) It also rules out option B (f(20) > 1000), as while it's true, we can't be certain it's always true for all functions satisfying the given conditions.

9) Option C (f(10) < 1000) is possible, but we can't be certain it's always true.

10) Option D (f(20) < 10000) is definitely true. We know f(20) > 6765, but we can't be certain it's always greater than 10000 for all functions satisfying the conditions.

Therefore, the only conclusion we can be certain of is option D.

The answer is $\boxed{D}$.

Answer:B

#### 9
Prompt: To understand the situation of mu income (unit: 10,000 yuan) after promoting exports, samples were taken from the planting area, and the sample mean of mu income after promoting exports was $\bar{x}=2.1$, with sample variance $s^2=0.01$. It is known that the mu income of this planting area in the past followed a normal distribution $M(1.8, 0.1^2)$. Assuming that the mu income $Y$ after promoting exports follows a normal distribution $N(\bar{x},s^2)$, then? (If random variable $Z$ follows a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $P(Z < \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.8413$)
A. $P(X > 2) > 0.2$
B. $P(X > 2) < 0.5$
C. $P(Y > 2) > 0.5$
D. $P(Y > 2) < 0.8$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that the mu income after promoting exports (Y) follows N(2.1, 0.01).

2) We need to calculate P(Y > 2).

3) To standardize this, we can use the z-score formula:
   z = (Y - μ) / σ
   where μ = 2.1 and σ = √0.01 = 0.1

4) We want P(Y > 2), which is equivalent to:
   P((Y - 2.1) / 0.1 > (2 - 2.1) / 0.1)
   P(Z > -1)

5) We know that P(Z < μ + σ) ≈ 0.8413
   This means P(Z < 1) ≈ 0.8413
   Therefore, P(Z > -1) = 1 - P(Z < -1) = 1 - (1 - 0.8413) = 0.8413

6) So, P(Y > 2) ≈ 0.8413

7) This probability is:
   > 0.5 (satisfying option C)
   < 0.8 (satisfying option D)

Both C and D are correct, but D is more precise.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{D. P(Y > 2) < 0.8}$

Answer:BC

#### 10
Prompt: Let the function $f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)$, then?
A. $x = 3$ is the local minimum point of $f(x)$
B. When $0 < x < 1$, $f(x) < f(x^2)$
C. When $1 < x < 2$, $-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$
D. When $-1 < x < 0$, $f(2 - x) > f(x)$

Response:

Let's analyze each option step by step:

A. To find the local minimum point, we need to find where f'(x) = 0.
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)
   f'(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 4) + (x - 1)^2
         = (x - 1)[2(x - 4) + (x - 1)]
         = (x - 1)(3x - 9)
   f'(x) = 0 when x = 1 or x = 3
   The second derivative test shows that x = 3 is indeed a local minimum.

B. Let's compare f(x) and f(x^2) when 0 < x < 1:
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)
   f(x^2) = (x^2 - 1)^2(x^2 - 4)
   When 0 < x < 1, x^2 < x, so (x^2 - 4) > (x - 4)
   Also, (x^2 - 1)^2 > (x - 1)^2
   Therefore, f(x^2) > f(x) when 0 < x < 1

C. When 1 < x < 2, we have 1 < 2x - 1 < 3
   f(2x - 1) = ((2x - 1) - 1)^2((2x - 1) - 4)
             = (2x - 2)^2(2x - 5)
             = 4(x - 1)^2(2x - 5)
   When 1 < x < 2, we have -3 < 2x - 5 < -1
   So -12(x - 1)^2 < f(2x - 1) < -4(x - 1)^2
   Therefore, -4 < f(2x - 1) < 0 is true.

D. When -1 < x < 0:
   f(2 - x) = (1 - x)^2(-2 + x)
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)
   (1 - x)^2 = (x - 1)^2, but (-2 + x) > (x - 4)
   Therefore, f(2 - x) > f(x) when -1 < x < 0

Options A, C, and D are correct, while B is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{A, C, D}$.

Answer:ACD

#### 11
Prompt: The shape $\alpha$ can be considered as part of the curve C shown in the figure. It is known that C passes through the origin O, and the points on C have x-coordinates greater than -2; the product of the distance from a point on C to point F(2,0) and its distance to the fixed line x = a(a < 0) is 4. Then:
A. $a = -2$
B. The point $(2√2,0)$ is on C
C. The maximum y-coordinate of points on C in the first quadrant is 1
D. When point $(x_0,y_0)$ is on C, $y_0 ≤ \frac{4}{(x_0 + 2)}$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The curve C is defined by the equation: (distance from point to F) × (distance from point to line x = a) = 4

2) Let's express this mathematically. For any point (x, y) on C:
   $\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \cdot (x - a) = 4$

3) We're told that C passes through the origin O(0,0). Let's use this information:
   $\sqrt{(0-2)^2 + 0^2} \cdot (0 - a) = 4$
   $2 \cdot (-a) = 4$
   $a = -2$

4) This confirms statement A is true.

5) For statement B, let's check if (2√2, 0) satisfies the equation:
   $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{2}-2)^2 + 0^2} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} - (-2)) = 4$
   $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{2}-2)^2} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4$
   $(2\sqrt{2}-2) \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4$
   $8 - 4 = 4$
   This is true, so statement B is correct.

6) For statement C, we need to find the maximum y-coordinate in the first quadrant.
   The equation in the first quadrant (x > 0) can be written as:
   $y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{16}{(x+2)^2} - (x-2)^2}$
   
   The maximum of this occurs when $x = 2$, giving $y = \pm 1$.
   So the maximum y-coordinate is indeed 1, confirming statement C.

7) For statement D, we can rearrange the original equation:
   $y^2 = (\frac{4}{x-a})^2 - (x-2)^2$
   $y^2 = (\frac{4}{x+2})^2 - (x-2)^2$ (since $a = -2$)
   
   For this to be real, we need:
   $(\frac{4}{x+2})^2 \geq (x-2)^2$
   $\frac{4}{x+2} \geq |x-2|$
   
   This is always true for $x \geq -2$, which is given in the problem.
   Therefore, $y^2 \leq (\frac{4}{x+2})^2$
   $|y| \leq \frac{4}{x+2}$
   $y \leq \frac{4}{x+2}$

   This confirms statement D.

Therefore, all statements A, B, C, and D are correct.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\text{A, B, C, and D are all correct}}$

Answer:ABD

#### 12
Prompt: Let the left and right foci of the hyperbola $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0)$ be $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. A line parallel to the y-axis is drawn through $F_2$, intersecting $C$ at points $A$ and $B$. If $|F_1A| = 13$ and $|AB| = 10$, what is the eccentricity of $C$?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For a hyperbola, the eccentricity e is given by $e = \frac{c}{a}$, where c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the length of the semi-major axis.

2) The equation of the hyperbola is in standard form, so the center is at (0,0) and the foci are on the x-axis.

3) The distance between the foci is 2c, and the right focus F₂ is at (c, 0).

4) Let's say point A is at (c, y) and B is at (c, -y), since the line through F₂ is parallel to the y-axis.

5) We're given that |F₁A| = 13 and |AB| = 10.

6) |AB| is the distance between A and B, which is 2y. So, y = 5.

7) Now, let's use the distance formula for |F₁A|:
   $\sqrt{(c-(-c))^2 + y^2} = 13$
   $\sqrt{4c^2 + 25} = 13$

8) Square both sides:
   $4c^2 + 25 = 169$
   $4c^2 = 144$
   $c^2 = 36$
   $c = 6$ (we take the positive value as c is a distance)

9) Now we need to find a. We can use the equation of the hyperbola:
   $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$

   At point A (c, y): $\frac{c^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$

10) Substitute the values we know:
    $\frac{36}{a^2} - \frac{25}{b^2} = 1$

11) We also know that for a hyperbola, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$
    So, $36 = a^2 + b^2$

12) From this, we can deduce that $b^2 = 36 - a^2$

13) Substituting this into the equation from step 10:
    $\frac{36}{a^2} - \frac{25}{36-a^2} = 1$

14) Solving this equation (which involves some complex algebra), we get:
    $a^2 = 25$
    $a = 5$

15) Now we can calculate the eccentricity:
    $e = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2$

Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is $\boxed{1.2}$.

Answer:$\frac{3}{2}$

#### 13
Prompt: If the tangent line to the curve $y = e^x + x$ at the point $(0, 1)$ is also a tangent line to the curve $y = \ln(x+1) + a$, then what is the value of $a$?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the equation of the tangent line to $y = e^x + x$ at (0, 1).

2) The derivative of $e^x + x$ is $e^x + 1$.

3) At x = 0, the slope of the tangent line is $e^0 + 1 = 2$.

4) Using point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line is:
   $y - 1 = 2(x - 0)$
   $y = 2x + 1$

5) Now, this line must also be tangent to $y = \ln(x+1) + a$.

6) For this to be true, the line must touch the curve at exactly one point. At this point, the y-values and slopes of the line and curve must be equal.

7) The derivative of $\ln(x+1) + a$ is $\frac{1}{x+1}$.

8) For the slopes to be equal:
   $2 = \frac{1}{x+1}$
   $x + 1 = \frac{1}{2}$
   $x = -\frac{1}{2}$

9) At this x-value, the y-values must be equal:
   $2(-\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = \ln(-\frac{1}{2}+1) + a$
   $0 = \ln(\frac{1}{2}) + a$

10) Solve for a:
    $a = -\ln(\frac{1}{2}) = \ln(2)$

Therefore, the value of a is $\boxed{\ln(2)}$.

Answer:$\ln2$

#### 14
Prompt: Person A and Person B each have four cards. Each card is marked with a number. A's cards are marked with numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7. B's cards are marked with numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8. They play a four-round game. In each round, both players randomly select one card from their remaining cards and compare the numbers on the selected cards. The player with the higher number scores 1 point, while the player with the lower number scores 0 points. Then, both players discard the cards used in that round (discarded cards cannot be used in subsequent rounds). What is the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to understand that for A to score at least 2 points, they need to win at least 2 rounds out of 4.

2) The possible outcomes for A are:
   - Win 2 rounds (score 2)
   - Win 3 rounds (score 3)
   - Win 4 rounds (score 4)

3) Let's calculate the probability of each of these outcomes:

4) To win 4 rounds:
   P(4 wins) = (1/4) * (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/1) = 1/24

5) To win exactly 3 rounds:
   There are 4C3 = 4 ways to choose which 3 rounds A wins.
   P(3 wins) = 4 * [(3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (0/1) + 
                    (3/4) * (2/3) * (0/2) * (1/1) + 
                    (3/4) * (0/3) * (1/2) * (1/1) + 
                    (0/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (1/1)]
              = 4 * [0 + 0 + 1/8 + 0] = 1/2

6) To win exactly 2 rounds:
   There are 4C2 = 6 ways to choose which 2 rounds A wins.
   P(2 wins) = 6 * [(3/4) * (2/3) * (0/2) * (0/1) + 
                    (3/4) * (0/3) * (1/2) * (0/1) + 
                    (3/4) * (0/3) * (0/2) * (1/1) + 
                    (0/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (0/1) + 
                    (0/4) * (2/3) * (0/2) * (1/1) + 
                    (0/4) * (0/3) * (1/2) * (1/1)]
              = 6 * [0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 0

7) The total probability of A scoring at least 2 points is:
   P(score ≥ 2) = P(4 wins) + P(3 wins) + P(2 wins)
                = 1/24 + 1/2 + 0
                = 13/24

Therefore, the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is $\boxed{\frac{13}{24}}$.

Answer:$\frac{1}{2}$

Prompt: Let the internal angles of triangle ABC be A, B, C, and their opposite sides be a, b, c respectively. Given that $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$ and $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$.
(1) Find B;
(2) If the area of triangle ABC is $3 + \sqrt{3}$, find c?

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) To find B:

Step 1: We're given that $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$. Let's square both sides:
$\sin^2 C = 2 \cos^2 B$

Step 2: We know that $\sin^2 C + \cos^2 C = 1$. Substituting:
$1 - \cos^2 C = 2 \cos^2 B$

Step 3: Rearranging:
$\cos^2 C + 2 \cos^2 B = 1$

Step 4: We're also given that $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$. Divide both sides by $c^2$:
$(\frac{a}{c})^2 + (\frac{b}{c})^2 - 1 = \sqrt{2}\frac{ab}{c^2}$

Step 5: Recall the cosine law: $\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}$. Applying this to our equation:
$\cos A + \cos B = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin C$

Step 6: From step 1, we know that $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$. Substituting:
$\cos A + \cos B = \cos B = \frac{1}{2}$

Step 7: Therefore, $\cos A = 0$ and $\cos B = \frac{1}{2}$

Step 8: So, $B = \arccos(\frac{1}{2}) = 60°$

Therefore, $\boxed{B = 60°}$

(2) To find c:

Step 1: We know that $A = 90°$ (since $\cos A = 0$) and $B = 60°$. Therefore, $C = 30°$.

Step 2: The area of a triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$. We're told this equals $3 + \sqrt{3}$:
$\frac{1}{2}ab\sin 30° = 3 + \sqrt{3}$

Step 3: $\sin 30° = \frac{1}{2}$, so:
$\frac{1}{4}ab = 3 + \sqrt{3}$
$ab = 12 + 4\sqrt{3}$

Step 4: From the cosine law for side c:
$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$
$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos 30°$
$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - ab\sqrt{3}$

Step 5: From the given equation:
$a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$
$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab$

Step 6: Equating these two expressions for $c^2$:
$a^2 + b^2 - ab\sqrt{3} = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab$
$ab(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}) = 0$
$ab = 0$ or $\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2} = 0$

The second equation is not true, so $ab \neq 0$.

Step 7: Substituting $ab = 12 + 4\sqrt{3}$ into $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab$:
$c^2 = (12 + 4\sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{2}(12 + 4\sqrt{3})$
$c^2 = 12 + 4\sqrt{3} - 12\sqrt{2} - 4\sqrt{6}$
$c^2 = 12 + 4\sqrt{3} - 4\sqrt{6} - 12\sqrt{2}$

Step 8: Taking the square root:
$c = \sqrt{12 + 4\sqrt{3} - 4\sqrt{6} - 12\sqrt{2}}$

Therefore, $\boxed{c = \sqrt{12 + 4\sqrt{3} - 4\sqrt{6} - 12\sqrt{2}}}$

Answer:(1) $B = \frac{\pi}{3}$ (2)$c = 2\sqrt{2}$

#### 16
Prompt: Given that $A(0,3)$ and $P(3,\frac{3}{2})$ are two points on the ellipse $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1(a > b > 0)$.
(1) Find the eccentricity of $C$;
(2) If a line $l$ passing through $P$ intersects $C$ at another point $B$, and the area of $\triangle ABP$ is 9, find the equation of $l$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) Finding the eccentricity of C:

Step 1: Given that A(0,3) is on the ellipse, we can substitute its coordinates into the equation:
$\frac{0^2}{a^2} + \frac{3^2}{b^2} = 1$
$\frac{9}{b^2} = 1$
$b^2 = 9$
$b = 3$

Step 2: Similarly, for P(3,3/2):
$\frac{3^2}{a^2} + \frac{(3/2)^2}{9} = 1$
$\frac{9}{a^2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1$
$\frac{9}{a^2} = \frac{3}{4}$
$a^2 = 12$
$a = 2\sqrt{3}$

Step 3: The eccentricity e is given by $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$:
$e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{12}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}$

(2) Finding the equation of line l:

Step 1: The general equation of a line passing through P(3,3/2) is:
$y - \frac{3}{2} = m(x - 3)$, where m is the slope.

Step 2: The area of a triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2}|x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$
For $\triangle ABP$, this becomes:
$9 = \frac{1}{2}|0(y_B - \frac{3}{2}) + 3(3 - y_B) + x_B(\frac{3}{2} - 3)|$
$18 = |3(3 - y_B) + x_B(-\frac{3}{2})|$

Step 3: The coordinates of B(x_B, y_B) must satisfy both the ellipse equation and the line equation:
$\frac{x_B^2}{12} + \frac{y_B^2}{9} = 1$
$y_B - \frac{3}{2} = m(x_B - 3)$

Step 4: Substituting the second equation into the first:
$\frac{x_B^2}{12} + \frac{(m(x_B - 3) + \frac{3}{2})^2}{9} = 1$

This equation, along with the area equation from Step 2, forms a system of equations in x_B and m. Solving this system (which is quite complex) would give us the value of m.

Step 5: Once m is found, the equation of line l would be:
$y - \frac{3}{2} = m(x - 3)$

Given the complexity of the final steps, the exact equation cannot be easily determined without further computation. However, the process to find it has been outlined.

The final answer for part (1) is: $\boxed{e = \frac{1}{2}}$

The equation for line l in part (2) would be of the form: $\boxed{y - \frac{3}{2} = m(x - 3)}$, where m is a specific value that satisfies the given conditions.

Answer:(1) $\frac{1}{2}$ (2) $y = \frac{1}{2} x$ 或 $y = \frac{3}{2} x -3$

Prompt: As shown in the figure, in the quadrangular pyramid P-ANCD, PA ⊥ base ABCD, PA = AC = 2, BC = 1, AB = √3.
(1) If AD ⊥ AB, prove that AD ∥ plane PBC;
(2) If AD ⊥ DC, and the sine value of the trihedral angle A-CP-D is $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$, find AD?

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) To prove that AD ∥ plane PBC:

Step 1: In a quadrangular pyramid, if a side of the base is perpendicular to the adjacent side and the height of the pyramid, then this side is parallel to the plane formed by the height and the opposite side of the base.

Step 2: We're given that AD ⊥ AB and PA ⊥ base ABCD.

Step 3: Therefore, AD ∥ plane PBC.

(2) To find AD when AD ⊥ DC and sin∠A-CP-D = $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$:

Step 1: In triangle PAC, PA = AC = 2, so it's an isosceles right triangle.
PC = √(PA² + AC²) = √(2² + 2²) = 2√2

Step 2: In triangle ABC, AB = √3, BC = 1, AC = 2
Using Pythagorean theorem: AB² + BC² = AC²
3 + 1 = 4, which is true.

Step 3: In triangle ACD, AD ⊥ DC
Let AD = x and DC = y
AC² = AD² + DC² (Pythagorean theorem)
4 = x² + y²

Step 4: In the trihedral angle A-CP-D:
sin∠A-CP-D = (AD * PC) / (AC * PD) = $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

(x * 2√2) / (2 * PD) = $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

x√2 / PD = $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

Step 5: PD² = PA² + AD²
PD² = 2² + x² = 4 + x²

Step 6: Substituting this into the equation from Step 4:
x√2 / √(4 + x²) = $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

Step 7: Squaring both sides:
2x² / (4 + x²) = 42/49

Step 8: Cross multiplying:
98x² = 42(4 + x²)
98x² = 168 + 42x²
56x² = 168
x² = 3

Therefore, AD = √3.

The final answer is $\boxed{AD = \sqrt{3}}$.

Answer:(1) $AD \parallel$ plane $PBC$ (2) $\sqrt{3}$

Prompt: Given the function $f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$,
(1) If $b = 0$, and $f'(x) \geq 0$, find the minimum value of $a$;
(2) Prove that the curve $y = f(x)$ is centrally symmetric;
(3) If $f(x) > -2$ if and only if $1 < x < 2$, find the range of values for $b$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) To find the minimum value of $a$ when $b = 0$ and $f'(x) \geq 0$:

Step 1: Calculate $f'(x)$ when $b = 0$:
$f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2-x} + a$

Step 2: For $f'(x) \geq 0$, we need:
$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2-x} + a \geq 0$

Step 3: The minimum value of $a$ will occur when this inequality is an equality:
$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2-x} + a = 0$

Step 4: The left side of this equation reaches its minimum when $x = 1$:
$\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2-1} + a = 0$
$1 + 1 + a = 0$
$a = -2$

Therefore, the minimum value of $a$ is $\boxed{-2}$.

(2) To prove that the curve $y = f(x)$ is centrally symmetric:

Step 1: For central symmetry, we need to show that $f(1+h) + f(1-h) = 2f(1)$ for all $h$.

Step 2: Let's examine each term of $f(x)$:

- For $\ln \frac{x}{2-x}$:
  $\ln \frac{1+h}{2-(1+h)} + \ln \frac{1-h}{2-(1-h)} = \ln \frac{1+h}{1-h} + \ln \frac{1-h}{1+h} = 0$

- For $ax$:
  $a(1+h) + a(1-h) = 2a$

- For $b(x-1)^3$:
  $b(1+h-1)^3 + b(1-h-1)^3 = bh^3 + b(-h)^3 = 0$

Step 3: Adding these up, we get $f(1+h) + f(1-h) = 2f(1)$, proving central symmetry.

(3) To find the range of values for $b$ when $f(x) > -2$ if and only if $1 < x < 2$:

Step 1: At $x = 1$ and $x = 2$, we must have $f(x) = -2$:

$f(1) = \ln \frac{1}{1} + a(1) + b(1-1)^3 = a = -2$
$f(2) = \ln \frac{2}{0} + a(2) + b(2-1)^3 = \infty + 2a + b = -2$

Step 2: From the first equation, we confirm $a = -2$.

Step 3: From the second equation, we see that $b$ must be negative for the equation to make sense.

Step 4: For $f(x) > -2$ when $1 < x < 2$, the function must be concave up in this interval. This means $f''(x) > 0$ for $1 < x < 2$.

Step 5: Calculate $f''(x)$:
$f''(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{(2-x)^2} + 6b(x-1)$

Step 6: At $x = 1$, this should be positive:
$f''(1) = -1 - 1 + 0 > 0$

This is impossible, so our initial assumption must be wrong. The function cannot be strictly greater than -2 for all $1 < x < 2$.

Therefore, there is $\boxed{\text{no valid range for } b}$ that satisfies the given condition.

Answer:(1)-2 (2) $y = f(x)$ is centrally symmetric about the point $(1,a)$ (3) $[-\frac{2}{3}, +\infty)$

#### 19
Prompt: Let $m$ be a positive integer, and the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ be an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference. If after deleting two terms $a_i$ and $a_j (i < j)$, the remaining $4m$ terms can be evenly divided into $m$ groups, and the 4 numbers in each group can form an arithmetic sequence, then the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is called an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence.
(1) List all $(i, j), 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 6$, that make the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6$ an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence.
(2) When $m \geq 3$, prove that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is a $(2, 13)$-divisible sequence.
(3) Randomly select two numbers $i$ and $j (i < j)$ once from $1, 2, \ldots, 4m+2$. Let the probability that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence be $P_m$. Prove that $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) For the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6$:

- We need to remove 2 terms to get 4 terms that form an arithmetic sequence.
- The possible combinations are:
  (1,2), (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (5,6)

Therefore, $\boxed{(1,2), (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (5,6)}$ are the $(i,j)$ pairs that make the sequence $(i,j)$-divisible.

(2) For $m \geq 3$, to prove that $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is a $(2, 13)$-divisible sequence:

- Removing $a_2$ and $a_{13}$ leaves 4m terms.
- These 4m terms can be divided into m groups of 4 terms each.
- Each group will be: $\{a_1, a_3, a_4, a_5\}$, $\{a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\}$, $\{a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{14}\}$, $\{a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\}$, ..., $\{a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}, a_{4m+1}, a_{4m+2}\}$
- In each group, the terms form an arithmetic sequence with the same common difference as the original sequence.

Therefore, the sequence is indeed a $(2, 13)$-divisible sequence.

(3) To prove that $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$:

- There are $\binom{4m+2}{2}$ ways to choose $(i,j)$.
- The sequence is $(i,j)$-divisible if $i$ and $j$ are of the form:
  $(4k+1, 4k+2)$, $(4k+2, 4k+3)$, $(4k+3, 4k+4)$, $(4k+4, 4k+5)$ for $k = 0, 1, ..., m-1$
  and $(4m+1, 4m+2)$
- There are $4m+1$ such pairs.

Therefore, $P_m = \frac{4m+1}{\binom{4m+2}{2}} = \frac{4m+1}{(4m+2)(4m+1)/2} = \frac{2(4m+1)}{(4m+2)(4m+1)} = \frac{2}{4m+2}$

For $m \geq 3$, $\frac{2}{4m+2} \geq \frac{2}{14} > \frac{1}{8}$

Thus, $\boxed{P_m > \frac{1}{8}}$ for $m \geq 3$.
