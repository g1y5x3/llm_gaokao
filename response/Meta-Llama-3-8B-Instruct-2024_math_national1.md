Prompt: Â∑≤Áü•ÈõÜÂêà $A = \{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$ Ôºå$B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$ ÔºåÂàô $A \cap B =$ Ôºü A. $\{-1, 0\}$ B. $\{2, 3\}$ C. $\{-3, -1, 0\}$ D. $\{-1, 0, 2\}$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the set $A = \{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$, which means that $A$ contains all real numbers $x$ such that $-5 < x^3 < 5$.

We are also given the set $B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$, which is a set of specific integers.

To find the intersection of $A$ and $B$, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets.

Let's start by finding the cube roots of the numbers in $B$:

* $-3$: $-3$ is not in $A$ because $(-3)^3 = -27 > 5$.
* $-1$: $-1$ is in $A$ because $(-1)^3 = -1 < 5$.
* $0$: $0$ is in $A$ because $0^3 = 0 < 5$.
* $2$: $2$ is in $A$ because $2^3 = 8 < 5$.
* $3$: $3$ is not in $A$ because $3^3 = 27 > 5$.

So, the elements that are common to both $A$ and $B$ are $-1$, $0$, and $2$.

Therefore, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{\{-1, 0, 2\}}$, which corresponds to option D.

Answer:A

Prompt: Ëã• $\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$ ÔºåÂàô $z =$Ôºü A. $-1 - i$ B. $-1 + i$ C. $1 - i$ D. $1 + i$

Response:

Let's start by writing the given equation:

$$\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$$

We can multiply both sides by $z-1$ to get:

$$z = z - 1 + i(z-1)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$z = z - 1 + iz - i$$

Combine like terms:

$$z = (1+i)z - 1 - i$$

Subtract $z$ from both sides:

$$0 = iz - 1 - i$$

Add $1+i$ to both sides:

$$1+i = iz$$

Multiply both sides by $z^{-1}$:

$$1+i z^{-1} = i$$

Take the imaginary part of both sides:

$$1 = 0$$

This is a contradiction, so the original equation has no solution.

However, we can try to find a complex conjugate of the original equation:

$$\frac{\bar{z}}{\bar{z}-1} = 1 - i$$

We can follow the same steps as before:

$$\bar{z} = \bar{z} - 1 - i(\bar{z}-1)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\bar{z} = \bar{z} - 1 - i\bar{z} + i$$

Combine like terms:

$$\bar{z} = (1-i)\bar{z} - 1 + i$$

Subtract $\bar{z}$ from both sides:

$$0 = (1-i)\bar{z} - 1 + i - \bar{z}$$

Add $\bar{z}$ to both sides:

$$\bar{z} = (1-i)\bar{z} - 1 + i$$

Multiply both sides by $(1-i)^{-1}$:

$$\bar{z} = \bar{z} - 1 + i(1-i)^{-1}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\bar{z} = \bar{z} - 1 + i$$

Subtract $\bar{z}$ from both sides:

$$0 = - 1 + i$$

This is a contradiction, so the complex conjugate equation also has no solution.

Therefore, the original equation has no solution.

The correct answer is:

\boxed{\text{None of the above}}

Response:

A nice vector problem! üòä

Let's start by writing the condition $b ‚ä• (b - 4a)$ in equation form:

$$b \cdot (b - 4a) = 0$$

Expanding the dot product, we get:

$$(2, x) \cdot ((2, x) - 4(0, 1)) = 0$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$(2, x) \cdot (2, x - 4) = 0$$

Expanding the dot product again, we get:

$$2(2) + x(x - 4) = 0$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$4 + x^2 - 4x = 0$$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$$

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

$$(x - 2)^2 = 0$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$x - 2 = 0$$

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

$$x = \boxed{\textbf{C. } 1}$$

So, the correct answer is C. 1. üëè

Prompt: Â∑≤Áü• $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$ Ôºå$\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$ ÔºåÂàô $\cos(\alpha - \beta) =$ Ôºü A. $-3m$ B. $\frac{m}{3}$ C. $\frac{m}{3}$ D. $3m$

Response:

Let's start by using the sum and difference formulas for cosine:

$$\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)$$

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)$$

We are given that $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$, so we can write:

$$m = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)$$

Now, we can use the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$ to rewrite the equation:

$$m = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)}$$

We are also given that $\tan(\alpha) \tan(\beta) = 2$, so we can write:

$$\frac{\sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)}{\cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta)} = 2$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$\frac{\sin^2(\alpha) \sin^2(\beta)}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

Using the Pythagorean identity again, we can rewrite the equation:

$$\frac{(1 - \cos^2(\alpha)) (1 - \cos^2(\beta))}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\frac{(1 - \cos^2(\alpha)) (1 - \cos^2(\beta))}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

$$\frac{(1 - \cos^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\alpha)) (1 - \cos^2(\beta) - \sin^2(\beta))}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

$$\frac{1 - 2 \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^4(\alpha) - 2 \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^4(\beta)}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

$$\frac{1 - 2 (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta)) + (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta))^2}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

$$\frac{1 - 2 (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta)) + (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta))^2}{\cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)} = 4$$

$$1 - 2 (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta)) + (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta))^2 = 4 \cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)$$

$$1 - 2 (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta)) + (\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta))^2 = 4 \cos^2(\alpha) \cos^2(\beta)$$

Response:

Let's start by using the given information to find the radius of the circular base of both the cylinder and the cone.

Since the circular base of the cylinder and the cone have the same radius, let's call this radius "r".

Since the side areas of the cylinder and the cone are equal, we can set up the following equation:

œÄr^2 = œÄr‚àö3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

r^2 = r‚àö3

r^2 - r‚àö3 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

(r - ‚àö3)(r + ‚àö3) = 0

This gives us two possible values for r: r = ‚àö3 and r = -‚àö3. However, since the radius cannot be negative, we take r = ‚àö3.

Now that we have found the radius, we can find the volume of the cone.

The volume of a cone is given by:

V = (1/3)œÄr^2h

where r is the radius of the circular base and h is the height of the cone. In this case, r = ‚àö3 and h = ‚àö3.

Plugging in the values, we get:

V = (1/3)œÄ(‚àö3)^2(‚àö3)
= (1/3)œÄ(3)‚àö3
= ‚àö3œÄ

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{\textbf{A. } 2\sqrt{3}\pi}

Prompt: Â∑≤Áü•ÂáΩÊï∞‰∏∫ $f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 - 2ax - a, & x < 0 \\ e^x + \ln(x+1), & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$ Âú® $R$ ‰∏äÂçïË∞ÉÈÄíÂ¢ûÔºåÂàô $a$ ÁöÑÂèñÂÄºËåÉÂõ¥ÊòØÔºü A. $(-\infty, 0]$ B. $[-1, 0]$ C. $[-1, 1]$ D. $[0, +\infty)$

Response:

A nice problem! üòä

Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the function**

We have a piecewise-defined function:

1. For $x < 0$, $f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a$
2. For $x \geq 0$, $f(x) = e^x + \ln(x+1)$

**Step 2: Find the critical points**

To determine the monotonicity of the function, we need to find the critical points, i.e., the points where the derivative changes sign.

For the first piece, $f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a$:

$$f'(x) = -2x - 2a$$

Set $f'(x) = 0$:

$$-2x - 2a = 0 \Rightarrow x = -a$$

So, the critical point is $x = -a$.

For the second piece, $f(x) = e^x + \ln(x+1)$:

$$f'(x) = e^x + \frac{1}{x+1}$$

This function is always positive for $x > 0$, so there are no critical points in this region.

**Step 3: Analyze the monotonicity**

Now, let's analyze the monotonicity of the function:

1. For $x < -a$, $f(x)$ is decreasing (since $f'(x) = -2x - 2a < 0$).
2. For $x = -a$, $f(x)$ has a critical point (but we don't know whether it's a local maximum or minimum).
3. For $x > -a$, $f(x)$ is increasing (since $f'(x) = e^x + \frac{1}{x+1} > 0$).

**Step 4: Determine the range of $a$**

Since we want the function to be monotonically increasing, we need to ensure that the function is increasing for all $x$. This means that:

* For $x < -a$, $f(x)$ is decreasing, but we can't have a local maximum at $x = -a$ (otherwise, $f(x)$ would be decreasing again for $x > -a$).
* For $x > -a$, $f(x)$ is increasing.

From the first piece, we have:

$$f'(-a) = -2(-a) - 2a = -4a$$

We need $f'(-a) > 0$, so $-4a > 0 \Rightarrow a < 0$. This means that the critical point $x = -a$ is a local minimum.

From the second piece, we have:

$$f'(-a) = e^{-a} + \frac{1}{-a+1} = e^{-a} - \frac{1}{a}$$

We need $f'(-a) > 0$, so $e^{-a} - \frac{1}{a} > 0$. This inequality is satisfied for all $a \in (-\infty, 0)$.

**Conclusion**

Combining the results, we have:

* $a < 0$ (from the local minimum condition)
* $a \in (-\infty, 0)$ (from the monotonicity condition)

Therefore, the range of $a$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }(-\infty, 0]}$. üëè

Prompt: ÂΩì $x \in [0, 2\pi]$ Êó∂ÔºåÊõ≤Á∫ø $y = \sin x$ ‰∏é $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$ ÁöÑ‰∫§ÁÇπ‰∏™Êï∞‰∏∫Ôºü A. 3 B. 4 C. 6 D. 8

Response:

A nice problem! üòä

Let's start by analyzing the equation of the second curve: $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$. This curve is a sine wave with a period of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, which is half of the period of the first curve ($y = \sin x$) with a period of $2\pi$.

Now, let's consider the intersection points between the two curves. For an intersection point, the values of $y$ must be equal, so we can set up the equation:

$$\sin x = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$$

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $\sin x$, which gives us:

$$1 = 2\cot(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$$

Now, we can rewrite this equation as:

$$\cot(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}$$

This equation has an infinite number of solutions, but we're interested in the ones that lie within the interval $[0, 2\pi]$. To find these solutions, we can use the fact that $\cot x$ has a period of $\pi$ and is positive in the interval $(0, \frac{\pi}{2})$.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$3x - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3} + k\pi, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$3x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$$

Now, we can solve for $x$:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{3}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$$

The values of $x$ that lie within the interval $[0, 2\pi]$ are:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{11\pi}{6}, \frac{4\pi}{3}$$

These are the intersection points between the two curves. However, we need to check that these points are indeed valid solutions by plugging them back into the original equation:

$$\sin x = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$$

After some calculations, we find that all of these points satisfy the equation. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{C. 6}}$ intersection points between the two curves.

Note that the answer choices are not exhaustive, as there could be more intersection points outside the interval $[0, 2\pi]$. However, within the given interval, there are indeed 6 intersection points. üòä

Response:

Let's start by analyzing the given conditions:

1. $f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$
This inequality implies that $f(x)$ is increasing with a rate greater than the sum of the rates of $f(x-1)$ and $f(x-2)$.

2. $f(x) = x$ when $x < 3$
This condition provides a base case for our analysis. We know that $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, and $f(2) = 2$.

Now, let's consider the case when $x = 3$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing with a rate greater than the sum of the rates of $f(x-1)$ and $f(x-2)$, we have:

$$f(3) > f(2) + f(1) = 3$$

So, $f(3) > 3$.

Next, let's consider the case when $x = 4$. We have:

$$f(4) > f(3) + f(2) = 5$$

So, $f(4) > 5$.

Continuing this process, we can show that:

$$f(5) > 7$$
$$f(6) > 9$$
$$f(7) > 11$$
$$f(8) > 13$$
$$f(9) > 15$$
$$f(10) > 17$$

Therefore, we have:

$$f(10) > 17$$

Now, let's consider the case when $x = 20$. We can show that:

$$f(20) > f(19) + f(18) = 39$$
$$f(20) > f(18) + f(17) = 40$$
$$f(20) > f(17) + f(16) = 41$$
...
$$f(20) > f(2) + f(1) = 43$$
$$f(20) > 43$$

So, $f(20) > 43$.

We can also show that:

$$f(20) > f(19) + f(18) = 40$$
$$f(20) > f(18) + f(17) = 41$$
...
$$f(20) > f(4) + f(3) = 45$$
$$f(20) > 45$$

So, $f(20) > 45$.

Finally, we can show that:

$$f(20) > f(10) + f(9) = 52$$
$$f(20) > 52$$

So, $f(20) > 52$.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that:

$$f(10) > 17$$
$$f(20) > 52$$

Now, let's check the options:

A. $f(10) > 100$ -> True
B. $f(20) > 1000$ -> True
C. $f(10) < 1000$ -> False
D. $f(20) < 10000$ -> False

So, the correct answers are A and B.

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the sample mean of the pushing-exported per-acre income is $\bar{x} = 2.1$, and the sample variance is $s^2 = 0.01$. Since the sample size is not given, we cannot calculate the sample standard deviation $s$.
2. We are told that the pushing-exported per-acre income $Y$ follows a normal distribution $N(\bar{x}, s^2)$, which means that $Y$ has a mean of $\bar{x} = 2.1$ and a variance of $s^2 = 0.01$.
3. We are also given that the per-acre income before pushing export follows a normal distribution $M(1.8, 0.1^2)$, which means that the mean is 1.8 and the variance is 0.01.
4. Since the variance of $Y$ is $s^2 = 0.01$, we know that the standard deviation of $Y$ is $\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1$.
5. Now, we want to find the probability that $Y > 2$. To do this, we need to find the z-score corresponding to $Y = 2$.

The z-score is calculated as:

z = (Y - Œº) / œÉ

where Œº is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation. In this case, Œº = 2.1 and œÉ = 0.1.

z = (2 - 2.1) / 0.1 = -0.1 / 0.1 = -1

Since the z-score is -1, we can look up the probability in a standard normal distribution table. We find that P(Z < -1) = 0.1587, which means that P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.1587 = 0.8413.

6. Therefore, we can conclude that P(Y > 2) = 0.8413.

So, the correct answer is:

\boxed{C. P(Y > 2) > 0.5}

Let's break down each statement:

A. $x = 3$ ÊòØ $f(x)$ ÁöÑÊûÅÂ∞èÂÄºÁÇπ

To find the critical points of $f(x)$, we set the derivative $f'(x)$ equal to 0:

$$f'(x) = 2(x-1)(x-4) + (x-1)^2(-2) = 0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$(x-1)(2x-4) = 0$$

This gives us $x = 1$ or $x = 2$. However, $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 4$, so neither of these points is a local minimum. Therefore, $\boxed{\text{A is false}}$.

B. ÂΩì $0 < x < 1$ Êó∂Ôºå$f(x) < f(x^2)$

To prove this statement, we can use the fact that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient. This means that $f(x)$ is concave down, and its graph opens downward.

Since $x^2 < x$ for $0 < x < 1$, we have $x^2 - 1 < x - 1$, which implies $(x^2 - 1)(x - 4) < (x - 1)(x - 4) = f(x)$. Therefore, $\boxed{\text{B is true}}$.

C. ÂΩì $1 < x < 2$ Êó∂Ôºå$-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$

To prove this statement, we can use the fact that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient. This means that $f(x)$ is concave down, and its graph opens downward.

Since $2x - 1 > x$ for $1 < x < 2$, we have $f(2x - 1) = (2x - 1 - 1)(2x - 1 - 4) = (x - 1)(2x - 5) > (x - 1)(x - 4) = f(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) > f(2x - 1) > 0$, which implies $-4 > f(2x - 1) > 0$. Therefore, $\boxed{\text{C is true}}$.

D. ÂΩì $-1 < x < 0$ Êó∂Ôºå$f(2 - x) > f(x)$

To prove this statement, we can use the fact that $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient. This means that $f(x)$ is concave down, and its graph opens downward.

Since $2 - x > x$ for $-1 < x < 0$, we have $f(2 - x) = (2 - x - 1)(2 - x - 4) = (1 - x)(-x - 2) > (x - 1)(x - 4) = f(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) < f(2 - x)$. Therefore, $\boxed{\text{D is true}}$.

Final answers:

A. False
B. True
C. True
D. True

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The point $F(2,0)$ lies on the curve $C$, and the distance from $F$ to the origin $O$ is 2. This means that the curve $C$ passes through the point $(2,0)$.
2. The distance from $F$ to the line $x=a$ is given by $\left|2-a\right|$. The product of this distance and the distance from $F$ to the origin is 4, so we can set up the equation:

$$\left|2-a\right|\cdot 2 = 4$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$\left|2-a\right| = 2$$

This means that either $2-a=2$ or $2-a=-2$. Solving for $a$, we get:

$$a = 0 \text{ or } a = -4$$

Since $a$ is given to be less than 0, we can conclude that $a = -4$.

3. Now that we know the value of $a$, we can use it to find the equation of the line $x=a$. The equation of the line is simply $x=-4$.
4. The curve $C$ passes through the point $(2,0)$, and the line $x=a$ passes through the point $(-4,0)$. To find the point of intersection between the curve and the line, we can set up the system of equations:

$$x = 2 \text{ and } x = -4$$

Solving this system, we get:

$$x = -4$$

This means that the curve $C$ intersects the line $x=a$ at the point $(-4,0)$.
5. Since the point $(-4,0)$ lies on the curve $C$, we can conclude that the curve $C$ passes through the point $(-4,0)$.
6. Now that we know the point of intersection, we can use it to find the equation of the curve $C$. Since the curve passes through the point $(-4,0)$, we can write the equation of the curve as:

$$y = f(x)$$

where $f(x)$ is some function of $x$.

7. Since the curve $C$ passes through the point $(2,0)$, we can substitute $x=2$ and $y=0$ into the equation of the curve to get:

$$0 = f(2)$$

This means that the function $f(x)$ satisfies the equation:

$$f(2) = 0$$

8. Now that we have the equation of the curve, we can use it to find the point $(2\sqrt{2},0)$. Substituting $x=2\sqrt{2}$ into the equation of the curve, we get:

$$0 = f(2\sqrt{2})$$

This means that the point $(2\sqrt{2},0)$ lies on the curve $C$.

9. Finally, we can use the equation of the curve to find the maximum value of the $y$-coordinate of the points on the curve in the first quadrant. Since the curve passes through the point $(2,0)$, we can conclude that the maximum value of the $y$-coordinate is 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{\text{B, C, D}}

Answer:ABD

Response:

Let's start by drawing a diagram:

In the diagram, $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the foci of the ellipse $C$, and $A$ and $B$ are the points of intersection of the line through $F_2$ parallel to the $y$-axis with $C$.

We are given that $|F_1A| = 13$ and $|AB| = 10$. We can use the fact that the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant to find the distance from $F_2$ to $A$:

$$|F_2A| = |F_1A| + |AB| = 13 + 10 = 23$$

Now, we can use the fact that the distance from a point on the ellipse to the center is equal to the eccentricity times the distance from the center to the focus to find the distance from the center to $F_2$:

$$|CF_2| = e|CF_1|$$

where $e$ is the eccentricity of the ellipse. We can use the fact that the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the line segment $F_1F_2$ to find the distance from the center to $F_1$:

$$|CF_1| = \frac{1}{2}|F_1F_2|$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$|CF_2| = e\left(\frac{1}{2}|F_1F_2|\right)$$

We can use the fact that the distance from a point on the ellipse to the center is equal to the semi-major axis minus the semi-minor axis to find the semi-major axis:

$$|CF_2| = a - b$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$a - b = e\left(\frac{1}{2}|F_1F_2|\right)$$

We can use the fact that the distance from a point on the ellipse to the center is equal to the semi-major axis minus the semi-minor axis to find the semi-minor axis:

$$|AB| = b$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$a - 10 = e\left(\frac{1}{2}|F_1F_2|\right)$$

We can use the fact that the distance from a point on the ellipse to the center is equal to the semi-major axis minus the semi-minor axis to find the semi-major axis:

$$|F_1F_2| = 2a$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$a - 10 = e(a)$$

Solving for $e$, we get:

$$e = \frac{a-10}{a}$$

We can use the fact that the semi-major axis is equal to the distance from the center to the vertex to find the semi-major axis:

$$a = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$a = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$a^2 = a^2+b^2$$

Subtracting $b^2$ from both sides, we get:

$$0 = b^2$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$b = 0$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$a = \sqrt{a^2+0^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$a = \sqrt{a^2}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$a^2 = a^2$$

Subtracting $a^2$ from both sides, we get:

$$0 = 0$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$a = 0$$

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

$$e = \frac{0-10}{0}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$e = \boxed{\frac{10}{0}}$$

Note that the value of $e$ is undefined, which means that the ellipse is a degenerate case (i.e. a single point).

Response:

Let's start by finding the derivative of the curve $y = e^x + x$:

$$y' = e^x + 1$$

Since the tangent line at $(0, 1)$ is also the tangent line of the curve $y = \ln(x+1) + a$, we can equate the slopes of the two curves at $x = 0$:

$$e^0 + 1 = \frac{1}{1+a}$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$1 + 1 = \frac{1}{1+a}$$

$$2 = \frac{1}{1+a}$$

$$2(1+a) = 1$$

$$2a + 1 = 1$$

$$2a = 0$$

$$a = \boxed{0}$$

Therefore, the value of $a$ is 0.

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Round 1:**
Áî≤ (K) and ‰πô (E) each randomly select a card from their respective sets. The possible outcomes are:

* K selects 1 and E selects 2: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 4: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.

* K selects 3 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.

In total, there are 16 possible outcomes in Round 1, and K wins 12 times and loses 4 times.

**Round 2:**
After Round 1, K and E each discard their selected cards. K now has 3 cards left (1, 3, 5, 7) and E has 3 cards left (2, 4, 6, 8). The possible outcomes in Round 2 are:

* K selects 1 and E selects 2: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.

* K selects 5 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.

Again, there are 16 possible outcomes in Round 2, and K wins 12 times and loses 4 times.

**Round 3:**
After Round 2, K and E each discard their selected cards again. K now has 2 cards left (1, 3, 5, 7) and E has 2 cards left (2, 4, 6, 8). The possible outcomes in Round 3 are:

* K selects 1 and E selects 2: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 4: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 6: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 8: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 3 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.

Again, there are 16 possible outcomes in Round 3, and K wins 12 times and loses 4 times.

**Round 4:**
After Round 3, K and E each discard their selected cards again. K now has 1 card left (1, 3, 5, 7) and E has 1 card left (2, 4, 6, 8). The possible outcomes in Round 4 are:

* K selects 1 and E selects 2: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 4: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 6: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 1 and E selects 8: K loses 0 points, E wins 1 point.
* K selects 3 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 3 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 5 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 2: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 4: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 6: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.
* K selects 7 and E selects 8: K wins 1 point, E loses 0 points.

Again, there are 16 possible outcomes in Round 4, and K wins 12 times and loses 4 times.

Now, let's count the number of ways K can get a total score of at least 2:

* K wins all 4 rounds: 12 possible outcomes in each round, so 12^4 = 20736 ways.
* K wins 3 rounds and loses 1 round: 12 possible outcomes in each round, so 12^3 \* 4 = 82944 ways.
* K wins 2 rounds and loses 2 rounds: 12 possible outcomes in each round, so 12^2 \* 6 = 15552 ways.
* K wins 1 round and loses 3 rounds: 12 possible outcomes in each round, so 12 \* 4 \* 4 = 384 ways.

Adding up these ways, we get 20736 + 82944 + 15552 + 384 = 131616 ways.

The total number of possible outcomes in 4 rounds is 16^4 = 65536.

So, the probability that K gets a total score of at least 2 is:

131616 / 65536 = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{2}

Response:

Let's solve the problem step by step.

(1) Solve for $\sin C$:

We are given that $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$. We can square both sides to get:

$$\sin^2 C = (\sqrt{2} \cos B)^2 = 2 \cos^2 B$$

Now, we can use the identity $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$ to get:

$$1 - \cos^2 C = 2 \cos^2 B$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\cos^2 C = 1 - 2 \cos^2 B$$

This is a quadratic equation in $\cos^2 B$, which can be factored as:

$$(\cos^2 B + 1)(1 - 2 \cos^2 B) = 0$$

This gives us two possible values for $\cos^2 B$: $\cos^2 B = -1$ or $\cos^2 B = \frac{1}{2}$. However, since $\cos^2 B \ge 0$, we can discard the first solution. Therefore, we have:

$$\cos^2 B = \frac{1}{2}$$

Taking the inverse cosine of both sides, we get:

$$\cos B = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

Since $\cos B$ is positive, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, we have:

$$\cos B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

Now, we can find $B$ using the inverse sine:

$$B = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}$$

(2) Solve for $c$:

We are given that the area of the triangle is $3 + \sqrt{3}$, and we need to find $c$. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin C$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2} ab \sqrt{2} \cos B$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$6 + 2 \sqrt{3} = ab \cos B$$

Now, we can use the identity $\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B}$ to get:

$$6 + 2 \sqrt{3} = ab \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$(6 + 2 \sqrt{3})^2 = a^2 b^2 (1 - \sin^2 B)$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$36 + 24 \sqrt{3} + 12 = a^2 b^2 - a^2 b^2 \sin^2 B$$

Factoring out $a^2 b^2$, we get:

$$a^2 b^2 (\sin^2 B + 1) = 48 + 24 \sqrt{3}$$

Now, we can use the identity $\sin^2 B + 1 = \cos^2 B$ to get:

$$a^2 b^2 \cos^2 B = 48 + 24 \sqrt{3}$$

Substituting the value of $\cos B$ from part (1), we get:

$$a^2 b^2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 48 + 24 \sqrt{3}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$a^2 b^2 = 96 + 48 \sqrt{3}$$

Now, we can use the given equation $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$ to get:

$$a^2 + b^2 - (96 + 48 \sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{2}ab$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$a^2 + b^2 - 96 - 48 \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{2}ab$$

Now, we can use the identity $\sqrt{2} = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{4}$ to get:

$$a^2 + b^2 - 96 - 48 \sqrt{3} = 2ab \sin \frac{\pi}{4}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$a^2 + b^2 - 96 - 48 \sqrt{3} = ab$$

Now, we can use the identity $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = (a + b + c)(a + b - c)$ to get:

$$(a + b + c)(a + b - c) = ab$$

Factoring out $a + b$, we get:

$$(a + b)(a + b - c) = ab$$

Dividing both sides by $ab$, we get:

$$a + b - c = 1$$

Now, we can use the given equation $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$ to get:

$$a^2 + b^2 - (a + b - c)^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$2ab = \sqrt{2}ab$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$c = a + b - 1$$

Substituting the value of $a^2 + b^2$ from part (1), we get:

$$c = \sqrt{96 + 48 \sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 1$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$c = \boxed{\sqrt{96 + 48 \sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 1}$$

Response:

Let's start by finding the equation of the ellipse.

The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the points $A(0,3)$ and $P(3,\frac{3}{2})$, which is $(1.5,2.25)$. The distance between the center and point $A$ is $\sqrt{(1.5-0)^2+(2.25-3)^2} = \sqrt{6.75} = \sqrt{\frac{27}{4}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The distance between the center and point $P$ is $\sqrt{(1.5-3)^2+(2.25-\frac{3}{2})^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the semi-minor axis is $b = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and the semi-major axis is $a = \frac{3}{2}$.

The eccentricity of the ellipse is given by $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2})^2}{(\frac{3}{2})^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Now, let's find the equation of the line $l$.

The slope of the line $l$ is $\frac{\frac{3}{2} - 3}{3 - 1.5} = -2$. The point $P$ lies on the line, so we can write the equation of the line as $y - \frac{3}{2} = -2(x - 3)$. Simplifying the equation, we get $y = -2x + 6$.

The area of the triangle $\triangle ABP$ is given by $\frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 9$. The base of the triangle is 3, and the height is also 3, since the triangle is isosceles.

The equation of the ellipse can be written as $\frac{(x-1.5)^2}{(\frac{3}{2})^2} + \frac{(y-2.25)^2}{(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = 1$. Substituting the point $B$ into the equation, we get $\frac{(x-1.5)^2}{(\frac{3}{2})^2} + \frac{(y-2.25)^2}{(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = 1$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = -2x + 6$.

Therefore, the equation of the line $l$ is $\boxed{y = -2x + 6}$.

Final Answer: The final answers are \boxed{\frac{1}{2}} and \boxed{y = -2x + 6}.

Response:

Let's break down the problems step by step.

**(1) If $AD \perp AB$, prove that $AD \parallel$ plane $PBC$**

Since $PA \perp$ the plane $ABCD$, we know that $P$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $ABCD$. Let $E$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. Then, we have:

* $\angle APE = 90^{\circ}$ (since $PA \perp$ the plane $ABCD$)
* $\angle ABE = 90^{\circ}$ (since $AB$ is a diameter of the circle with center $A$ and radius $AB$)
* $\angle EBC = 90^{\circ}$ (since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle with center $B$ and radius $BC$)

Therefore, we have:

* $\angle AEP = \angle ABE = 90^{\circ}$
* $\angle EPC = \angle EBC = 90^{\circ}$

Since $\angle AEP = \angle EPC = 90^{\circ}$, we have:

* $E$ lies on the line $AP$
* $P$ lies on the line $EC$

Therefore, we have:

* $AP \parallel EC$
* $AP \parallel BC$ (since $P$ lies on the line $BC$)

Since $AP \parallel BC$ and $AP \parallel EC$, we have:

* $AP \parallel BCE$

Therefore, we have:

* $AD \parallel BCE$ (since $AD \perp AB$ and $AB \parallel BCE$)

Since $AD \parallel BCE$ and $AP \parallel BCE$, we have:

* $AD \parallel AP$

Therefore, we have:

* $AD \parallel PBC$

**(2) If $AD \perp DC$, and the sine of angle $A-CP-D$ is $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$, find $AD$**

Let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $DC$. Then, we have:

* $\angle AHD = 90^{\circ}$ (since $AD \perp DC$)
* $\angle ACP = 90^{\circ}$ (since $CP$ is the altitude from $A$ to $BC$)

Since $\angle AHD = 90^{\circ}$ and $\angle ACP = 90^{\circ}$, we have:

* $\angle HDC = \angle CPD$ (since $H$ and $C$ are on the same side of $AD$)

Therefore, we have:

* $\angle HDC = \angle CPD = \angle CPD - \angle ACP = 90^{\circ} - \angle ACP$

Since $\angle HDC = 90^{\circ} - \angle ACP$, we have:

* $\sin \angle ACP = \sin (90^{\circ} - \angle ACP) = \cos \angle ACP$

Since $\sin \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$, we have:

* $\cos \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

Since $\cos \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$, we have:

* $\sin \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

Therefore, we have:

* $\sin \angle ACP = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$

Now, we can use the law of sines to find $AD$:

* $\frac{\sin \angle ACP}{AD} = \frac{\sin \angle ACP}{AC}$
* $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{2}$
* $AD = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}

Response:

Let's solve the problems step by step.

**(1) Find the minimum value of $a$ when $b = 0$ and $f'(x) \geq 0$**

When $b = 0$, we have $f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + c$ for some constant $c$.

The derivative of $f(x)$ is:

$$f'(x) = \frac{1}{x(2-x)} + a$$

Since $f'(x) \geq 0$, we have:

$$\frac{1}{x(2-x)} + a \geq 0$$

The minimum value of $a$ occurs when the equality holds. We can solve for $a$:

$$\frac{1}{x(2-x)} + a = 0 \Rightarrow a = -\frac{1}{x(2-x)}$$

The minimum value of $a$ is therefore:

$$a_{min} = \boxed{-\infty}$$

**(2) Prove that the curve $y = f(x)$ is center-symmetric**

We can rewrite $f(x)$ as:

$$f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$$

$$= \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1)$$

$$= \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b$$

We can see that the curve is center-symmetric because the term $\ln \frac{x}{2-x}$ is symmetric about the origin, and the term $ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b$ is also symmetric about the origin.

**(3) Find the range of $b$ such that $f(x) > -2$ when $1 < x < 2$**

We can rewrite $f(x)$ as:

$$f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$$

$$= \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1)$$

$$= \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b$$

We can see that $f(x) > -2$ when $1 < x < 2$ is equivalent to:

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b > -2$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 > 0$$

The above inequality is true when:

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$

$$\ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + bx^3 - 3bx^2 + 3bx - b + 2 \geq 0$$
