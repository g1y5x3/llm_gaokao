Prompt: Given set $A = \{x | -5 < x^3 < 5\}$, $B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}$, then $A \cap B =$ ?
A. $\{-1, 0\}$
B. $\{2, 3\}$
C. $\{-3, -1, 0\}$
D. $\{-1, 0, 2\}$

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start by analyzing the given sets \( A \) and \( B \).

1. **Set \( A \)**:
   \[
   A = \{x \mid -5 < x^3 < 5\}
   \]
   We need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).

   - For \( x^3 = -5 \), we solve \( x = \sqrt[3]{-5} \approx -1.71 \).
   - For \( x^3 = 5 \), we solve \( x = \sqrt[3]{5} \approx 1.71 \).

   Therefore, the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \) are within the range \( -1.71 < x < 1.71 \).

2. **Set \( B \)**:
   \[
   B = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 3\}
   \]

3. **Intersection \( A \cap B \)**:
   We need to find the elements in \( B \) that also belong to \( A \).

   - Check each element of \( B \) to see if it lies within the range \( -1.71 < x < 1.71 \):
     - \( -3 \): \( -3^3 = -27 \), which is not in the range \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).
     - \( -1 \): \( -1^3 = -1 \), which is in the range \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).
     - \( 0 \): \( 0^3 = 0 \), which is in the range \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).
     - \( 2 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \), which is not in the range \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).
     - \( 3 \): \( 3^3 = 27 \), which is not in the range \( -5 < x^3 < 5 \).

   Therefore, the elements of \( B \) that are in \( A \) are \( -1 \) and \( 0 \).

Thus, the intersection \( A \cap B \) is:
\[
A \cap B = \{-1, 0\}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Answer:A

#### 2
Prompt: If $\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i$, then $z =$ ?
A. $-1 - i$
B. $-1 + i$
C. $1 - i$
D. $1 + i$

Response:

To solve the equation \(\frac{z}{z-1} = 1 + i\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Multiply both sides by \(z - 1\)** to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   z = (1 + i)(z - 1)
   \]

2. **Expand the right-hand side**:
   \[
   z = (1 + i)z - (1 + i)
   \]

3. **Distribute \(1 + i\)**:
   \[
   z = z + iz - 1 - i
   \]

4. **Rearrange the equation to isolate \(z\)**:
   \[
   z - z - iz = -1 - i
   \]

5. **Combine like terms**:
   \[
   -iz = -1 - i
   \]

6. **Divide both sides by \(-i\)** to solve for \(z\):
   \[
   z = \frac{-1 - i}{-i}
   \]

7. **Simplify the fraction**:
   \[
   z = \frac{-1 - i}{-i} = \frac{-1}{-i} + \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{1}{i} + 1
   \]

8. **Simplify \(\frac{1}{i}\)**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{i} = -i \quad \text{(since } \frac{1}{i} \cdot \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{-i}{-1} = -i \text{)}
   \]

9. **Combine the results**:
   \[
   z = -i + 1 = 1 - i
   \]

Thus, the solution is \(\boxed{C}\).

Answer:C

#### 3
Prompt: Given vectors $a = (0,1)$ and $b = (2,x)$. If $b âŠ¥ (b - 4a)$, then $x =$ ?
A. -2
B. -1
C. 1
D. 2

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the vector \( b \) is perpendicular to the vector \( b - 4a \).

Given:
- \( a = (0, 1) \)
- \( b = (2, x) \)

First, we calculate the vector \( b - 4a \):
\[
b - 4a = (2, x) - 4(0, 1) = (2, x) - (0, 4) = (2, x - 4)
\]

Next, we need to ensure that \( b \) is perpendicular to \( b - 4a \). Two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. Therefore, we compute the dot product of \( b \) and \( b - 4a \):
\[
b \cdot (b - 4a) = (2, x) \cdot (2, x - 4)
\]

The dot product is calculated as follows:
\[
(2, x) \cdot (2, x - 4) = 2 \cdot 2 + x \cdot (x - 4) = 4 + x(x - 4)
\]

We set the dot product equal to zero to find \( x \):
\[
4 + x(x - 4) = 0
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
4 + x^2 - 4x = 0
\]

Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
\]

This can be factored as:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Answer:D

#### 4
Prompt: Given $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$ and $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2$, what is $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$?
A. $-3m$
B. $\frac{m}{3}$
C. $\frac{m}{3}$
D. $3m$

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, we start with the given information:

1. \(\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m\)
2. \(\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2\)

We need to find \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\).

First, recall the trigonometric identity for the cosine of the sum of two angles:
\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\]
Given \(\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m\), we can write:
\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = m
\]

Next, recall the trigonometric identity for the cosine of the difference of two angles:
\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\]

We need to express \(\sin \alpha \sin \beta\) in terms of \(\cos \alpha \cos \beta\). Using the given \(\tan \alpha \tan \beta = 2\), we know:
\[
\tan \alpha \tan \beta = \frac{\sin \alpha \sin \beta}{\cos \alpha \cos \beta} = 2
\]
Thus:
\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta = 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta
\]

Substitute \(\sin \alpha \sin \beta = 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta\) into the equation for \(\cos(\alpha + \beta)\):
\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta - 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta = m
\]
Simplify:
\[
-\cos \alpha \cos \beta = m
\]
Thus:
\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta = -m
\]

Now, substitute \(\cos \alpha \cos \beta = -m\) and \(\sin \alpha \sin \beta = 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta\) into the equation for \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\):
\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = -m + 2(-m)
\]
\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = -m - 2m
\]
\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = -3m
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Answer:A

#### 5
Prompt: Given that a cylinder and a cone have equal base radii, equal lateral surface areas, and both have a height of $\sqrt{3}$, what is the volume of the cone?
A. $2\sqrt{3}\pi$
B. $3\sqrt{3}\pi$
C. $6\sqrt{3}\pi$
D. $9\sqrt{3}\pi$

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start by defining the variables and using the given information.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the radius of the base of both the cylinder and the cone be \( r \).
   - The height of both the cylinder and the cone is given as \( \sqrt{3} \).

2. **Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder:**
   - The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
     \[
     \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r h
     \]
   - Substituting the given height \( h = \sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r \sqrt{3}
     \]

3. **Lateral Surface Area of the Cone:**
   - The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:
     \[
     \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi r l
     \]
   - Where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. Given that the lateral surface areas of the cylinder and the cone are equal:
     \[
     \pi r l = 2\pi r \sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by \( \pi r \):
     \[
     l = 2\sqrt{3}
     \]

4. **Find the Radius \( r \):**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius \( r \), the height \( \sqrt{3} \), and the slant height \( l \):
     \[
     l^2 = r^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( l = 2\sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     (2\sqrt{3})^2 = r^2 + 3
     \]
     \[
     12 = r^2 + 3
     \]
     \[
     r^2 = 9
     \]
     \[
     r = 3
     \]

5. **Volume of the Cone:**
   - The formula for the volume of a cone is:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
     \]
   - Substituting \( r = 3 \) and \( h = \sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 \sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 9 \cdot \sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     V = 3\sqrt{3}\pi
     \]

Thus, the volume of the cone is \(\boxed{B}\).

Answer:B

#### 6
Prompt: Given the function $f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 - 2ax - a, & x < 0 \\ e^x + \ln(x+1), & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$ is monotonically increasing on $R$, what is the range of values for $a$?
A. $(-\infty, 0]$
B. $[-1, 0]$
C. $[-1, 1]$
D. $[0, +\infty)$

Response:

To determine the range of values for \( a \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is monotonically increasing on \( \mathbb{R} \), we need to analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) in both parts of its domain.

1. **For \( x < 0 \):**
   The function is given by \( f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a \).

   To determine if \( f(x) \) is increasing for \( x < 0 \), we need to check the derivative \( f'(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(-x^2 - 2ax - a) = -2x - 2a
   \]

   For \( f(x) \) to be increasing, \( f'(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x < 0 \):
   \[
   -2x - 2a \geq 0 \implies -2x \geq 2a \implies x \leq -a
   \]

   Since \( x < 0 \), the inequality \( x \leq -a \) must hold for all \( x < 0 \). This implies:
   \[
   -a \geq 0 \implies a \leq 0
   \]

2. **For \( x \geq 0 \):**
   The function is given by \( f(x) = e^x + \ln(x+1) \).

   To determine if \( f(x) \) is increasing for \( x \geq 0 \), we need to check the derivative \( f'(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(e^x + \ln(x+1)) = e^x + \frac{1}{x+1}
   \]

   Both \( e^x \) and \( \frac{1}{x+1} \) are positive for \( x \geq 0 \), so \( f'(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( f(x) \) is monotonically increasing for \( x \geq 0 \).

3. **Continuity at \( x = 0 \):**
   To ensure the function is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x)
   \]

   Calculate the limits:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = -0^2 - 2a \cdot 0 - a = -a
   \]
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = e^0 + \ln(0+1) = 1 + 0 = 1
   \]

   For continuity at \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   -a = 1 \implies a = -1
   \]

4. **Combining the results:**
   - From the monotonicity condition for \( x < 0 \), we have \( a \leq 0 \).
   - From the continuity condition at \( x = 0 \), we have \( a = -1 \).

   Therefore, the range of values for \( a \) that satisfies both conditions is \( a = -1 \).

Thus, the range of values for \( a \) is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Answer:B

#### 7
Prompt: When $x \in [0, 2\pi]$, how many intersection points are there between the curves $y = \sin x$ and $y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})$?
A. 3
B. 4
C. 6
D. 8

Response:

To determine the number of intersection points between the curves \( y = \sin x \) and \( y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) \) for \( x \in [0, 2\pi] \), we need to solve the equation:

\[
\sin x = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})
\]

First, we use the identity for the sine of a difference:

\[
\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) = \sin 3x \cos \frac{\pi}{6} - \cos 3x \sin \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

Since \(\cos \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\sin \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:

\[
\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) = \sin 3x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \cos 3x \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\sin x = 2 \left( \sin 3x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \cos 3x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
\sin x = \sqrt{3} \sin 3x - \cos 3x
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation:

\[
\sin x - \sqrt{3} \sin 3x + \cos 3x = 0
\]

To solve this, we need to analyze the behavior of both \(\sin x\) and \(2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

1. **Periodicity and Range Analysis**:
   - The function \(\sin x\) has a period of \(2\pi\) and ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\).
   - The function \(2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})\) has a period of \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) and ranges from \(-2\) to \(2\).

2. **Intersection Points**:
   - Since \(2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})\) ranges from \(-2\) to \(2\), it intersects \(\sin x\) multiple times within one period of \(\sin x\).
   - We need to count the number of intersections within the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

3. **Graphical Analysis**:
   - The function \(\sin x\) completes one full cycle in \([0, 2\pi]\).
   - The function \(2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6})\) completes three full cycles in \([0, 2\pi]\).

Given the periodicity and the range of both functions, we can infer that the number of intersection points is determined by the number of times the two curves cross each other within the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

By examining the graphs and considering the periodicity and range, we find that the curves intersect at 6 distinct points within the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

Thus, the number of intersection points is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

Answer:C

#### 8
Prompt: Given that the domain of function $f(x)$ is $R$, $f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$, and when $x < 3$, $f(x) = x$, which of the following conclusions is definitely correct?
A. $f(10) > 100$
B. $f(20) > 1000$
C. $f(10) < 1000$
D. $f(20) < 10000$

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and derive the correct conclusion step by step.

1. **Understanding the function and its domain:**
   - The domain of \( f(x) \) is \( \mathbb{R} \).
   - The function satisfies the inequality \( f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2) \).
   - For \( x < 3 \), \( f(x) = x \).

2. **Analyzing the initial values:**
   - For \( x < 3 \), \( f(x) = x \).
   - Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), and \( f(2) = 2 \).

3. **Using the inequality \( f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2) \):**
   - We need to determine how \( f(x) \) grows as \( x \) increases.
   - Let's compute a few values to see the pattern:
     - For \( x = 3 \):
       \[
       f(3) > f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
       \]
       So, \( f(3) > 3 \).
     - For \( x = 4 \):
       \[
       f(4) > f(3) + f(2) = f(3) + 2
       \]
       Since \( f(3) > 3 \), we have:
       \[
       f(4) > 3 + 2 = 5
       \]
     - For \( x = 5 \):
       \[
       f(5) > f(4) + f(3) = f(4) + f(3)
       \]
       Since \( f(4) > 5 \) and \( f(3) > 3 \), we have:
       \[
       f(5) > 5 + 3 = 8
       \]

4. **Generalizing the growth pattern:**
   - We observe that \( f(x) \) grows faster than the sum of the previous two values.
   - This suggests that \( f(x) \) grows exponentially.

5. **Estimating \( f(10) \) and \( f(20) \):**
   - Since \( f(x) \) grows exponentially, we can infer that:
     - \( f(10) \) will be significantly larger than 100.
     - \( f(20) \) will be significantly larger than 1000.

6. **Evaluating the given options:**
   - A. \( f(10) > 100 \)
     - This is likely true but not necessarily the strongest conclusion.
   - B. \( f(20) > 1000 \)
     - This is also likely true but not necessarily the strongest conclusion.
   - C. \( f(10) < 1000 \)
     - This is the strongest conclusion we can make based on the exponential growth.
   - D. \( f(20) < 10000 \)
     - This is less certain compared to option C.

Therefore, the conclusion that is definitely correct is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Answer:B

#### 9
Prompt: To understand the situation of mu income (unit: 10,000 yuan) after promoting exports, samples were taken from the planting area, and the sample mean of mu income after promoting exports was $\bar{x}=2.1$, with sample variance $s^2=0.01$. It is known that the mu income of this planting area in the past followed a normal distribution $M(1.8, 0.1^2)$. Assuming that the mu income $Y$ after promoting exports follows a normal distribution $N(\bar{x},s^2)$, then? (If random variable $Z$ follows a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $P(Z < \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.8413$)
A. $P(X > 2) > 0.2$
B. $P(X > 2) < 0.5$
C. $P(Y > 2) > 0.5$
D. $P(Y > 2) < 0.8$

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start by understanding the given information and the distributions involved.

1. **Given Information:**
   - The sample mean of mu income after promoting exports is \(\bar{x} = 2.1\).
   - The sample variance is \(s^2 = 0.01\).
   - The mu income of the planting area in the past followed a normal distribution \(M(1.8, 0.1^2)\).
   - The mu income \(Y\) after promoting exports is assumed to follow a normal distribution \(N(\bar{x}, s^2)\).

2. **Distribution of \(Y\):**
   - Since \(\bar{x} = 2.1\) and \(s^2 = 0.01\), the distribution of \(Y\) is \(N(2.1, 0.01)\).

3. **Standard Normal Distribution:**
   - We need to find the probability \(P(Y > 2)\).
   - First, convert \(Y\) to a standard normal variable \(Z\):
     \[
     Z = \frac{Y - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{Y - 2.1}{0.1}
     \]
   - For \(Y = 2\):
     \[
     Z = \frac{2 - 2.1}{0.1} = \frac{-0.1}{0.1} = -1
     \]

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - We need to find \(P(Z > -1)\).
   - Using the properties of the standard normal distribution:
     \[
     P(Z > -1) = 1 - P(Z < -1)
     \]
   - From the standard normal distribution table, \(P(Z < -1) \approx 0.1587\).
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(Z > -1) = 1 - 0.1587 = 0.8413
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - We have found that \(P(Y > 2) = 0.8413\).
   - Now, we need to match this result with the given options:
     - A. \(P(X > 2) > 0.2\)
     - B. \(P(X > 2) < 0.5\)
     - C. \(P(Y > 2) > 0.5\)
     - D. \(P(Y > 2) < 0.8\)

   - The correct option is \(C\) because \(0.8413 > 0.5\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{C}\).

Answer:BC

#### 10
Prompt: Let the function $f(x) = (x - 1)^2(x - 4)$, then?
A. $x = 3$ is the local minimum point of $f(x)$
B. When $0 < x < 1$, $f(x) < f(x^2)$
C. When $1 < x < 2$, $-4 < f(2x - 1) < 0$
D. When $-1 < x < 0$, $f(2 - x) > f(x)$

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to analyze each option step by step. Let's start by considering the function \( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 (x - 4) \).

### Option A: \( x = 3 \) is the local minimum point of \( f(x) \)

To determine if \( x = 3 \) is a local minimum, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero.

1. **Find the derivative \( f'(x) \):**
   \[
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2 (x - 4)
   \]
   Using the product rule and chain rule:
   \[
   f'(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 4) + (x - 1)^2 \cdot 1
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   f'(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 4) + (x - 1)^2 = (x - 1)[2(x - 4) + (x - 1)] = (x - 1)(2x - 8 + x - 1) = (x - 1)(3x - 9)
   \]
   \[
   f'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3)
   \]

2. **Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:**
   \[
   3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us critical points at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).

3. **Determine the nature of the critical points:**
   - For \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[3(x - 1)(x - 3)] = 3[(x - 1) + (x - 3)] = 3(2x - 4) = 6x - 12
     \]
     \[
     f''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 \quad (\text{negative, so } x = 1 \text{ is a local maximum})
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     f''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 \quad (\text{positive, so } x = 3 \text{ is a local minimum})
     \]

Thus, \( x = 3 \) is indeed a local minimum. Therefore, option A is correct.

### Option B: When \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( f(x) < f(x^2) \)

1. **Evaluate \( f(x) \) and \( f(x^2) \) in the interval \( 0 < x < 1 \):**
   \[
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2 (x - 4)
   \]
   \[
   f(x^2) = (x^2 - 1)^2 (x^2 - 4)
   \]

2. **Compare \( f(x) \) and \( f(x^2) \):**
   - For \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( x^2 \) is also in the interval \( 0 < x^2 < 1 \).
   - Since \( f(x) \) is a continuous function, we need to check if \( f(x) < f(x^2) \) holds for all \( x \) in this interval.

   By inspection, \( f(x) \) and \( f(x^2) \) can be compared directly, but without detailed calculation, we cannot definitively conclude that \( f(x) < f(x^2) \) for all \( x \) in \( 0 < x < 1 \).

### Option C: When \( 1 < x < 2 \), \( -4 < f(2x - 1) < 0 \)

1. **Evaluate \( f(2x - 1) \) in the interval \( 1 < x < 2 \):**
   \[
   f(2x - 1) = (2x - 2)^2 (2x - 5)
   \]

2. **Check the range of \( f(2x - 1) \):**
   - For \( 1 < x < 2 \), \( 1 < 2x - 1 < 3 \).
   - Evaluate \( f(2x - 1) \) at the boundaries:
     \[
     f(1) = (1 - 1)^2 (1 - 4) = 0
     \]
     \[
     f(3) = (3 - 1)^2 (3 - 4) = 4(-1) = -4
     \]

   Since \( f(2x - 1) \) is continuous and varies between \( 0 \) and \( -4 \) in the interval \( 1 < 2x - 1 < 3 \), it does not necessarily satisfy \( -4 < f(2x - 1) < 0 \).

### Option D: When \( -1 < x < 0 \), \( f(2 - x) > f(x) \)

1. **Evaluate \( f(2 - x) \) and \( f(x) \) in the interval \( -1 < x < 0 \):**
   \[
   f(2 - x) = (2 - x - 1)^2 (2 - x - 4) = (1 - x)^2 (-2 - x)
   \]
   \[
   f(x) = (x - 1)^2 (x - 4)
   \]

2. **Compare \( f(2 - x) \) and \( f(x) \):**
   - For \( -1 < x < 0 \), \( 2 - x \) is in the interval \( 2 < 2 - x < 3 \).
   - By inspection, \( f(2 - x) \) and \( f(x) \) can be compared directly, but without detailed calculation, we cannot definitively conclude that \( f(2 - x) > f(x) \) for all \( x \) in this interval.

Given the analysis, the correct option is:

\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Answer:ACD

#### 11
Prompt: The shape $\alpha$ can be considered as part of the curve C shown in the figure. It is known that C passes through the origin O, and the points on C have x-coordinates greater than -2; the product of the distance from a point on C to point F(2,0) and its distance to the fixed line x = a(a < 0) is 4. Then:
A. $a = -2$
B. The point $(2âˆš2,0)$ is on C
C. The maximum y-coordinate of points on C in the first quadrant is 1
D. When point $(x_0,y_0)$ is on C, $y_0 â‰¤ \frac{4}{(x_0 + 2)}$

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and derive the correct answer step by step.

1. **Understanding the given conditions:**
   - The curve \( C \) passes through the origin \( O \).
   - The x-coordinates of points on \( C \) are greater than -2.
   - The product of the distance from a point on \( C \) to the point \( F(2,0) \) and its distance to the fixed line \( x = a \) (where \( a < 0 \)) is 4.

2. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Let \( (x, y) \) be a point on the curve \( C \).
   - The distance from \( (x, y) \) to \( F(2,0) \) is \( \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \).
   - The distance from \( (x, y) \) to the line \( x = a \) is \( |x - a| \).
   - According to the given condition, the product of these distances is 4:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \cdot |x - a| = 4
     \]

3. **Simplifying the equation:**
   - Since \( a < 0 \), we can write \( |x - a| = x - a \) (because \( x > -2 \) and \( a < 0 \), so \( x - a > 0 \)).
   - Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \cdot (x - a) = 4
     \]

4. **Analyzing the options:**
   - **Option A: \( a = -2 \)**
     - If \( a = -2 \), the equation becomes:
       \[
       \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \cdot (x + 2) = 4
       \]
     - This is a valid equation, but we need to check if it fits all conditions and if it is the only correct option.

   - **Option B: The point \( (2\sqrt{2}, 0) \) is on \( C \)**
     - Substituting \( (2\sqrt{2}, 0) \) into the equation:
       \[
       \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2} - 2)^2 + 0^2} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4
       \]
       \[
       \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2} - 2)^2} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4
       \]
       \[
       |2\sqrt{2} - 2| \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4
       \]
       - This simplifies to:
         \[
         (2\sqrt{2} - 2) \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 2) = 4
         \]
         \[
         (2\sqrt{2})^2 - 2^2 = 4
         \]
         \[
         8 - 4 = 4
         \]
         \[
         4 = 4
         \]
       - This is true, but we need to check if it is the only correct option.

   - **Option C: The maximum y-coordinate of points on \( C \) in the first quadrant is 1**
     - This requires further analysis of the curve, but based on the given conditions, we cannot definitively conclude this without more detailed calculations.

   - **Option D: When point \( (x_0, y_0) \) is on \( C \), \( y_0 \leq \frac{4}{(x_0 + 2)} \)**
     - This also requires further analysis, but based on the given conditions, we cannot definitively conclude this without more detailed calculations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the only option that can be definitively confirmed with the given conditions is Option A.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Answer:ABD

#### 12
Prompt: Let the left and right foci of the hyperbola $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0)$ be $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. A line parallel to the y-axis is drawn through $F_2$, intersecting $C$ at points $A$ and $B$. If $|F_1A| = 13$ and $|AB| = 10$, what is the eccentricity of $C$?

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start by understanding the given information and the properties of the hyperbola.

1. **Hyperbola Equation and Foci**:
   The equation of the hyperbola is given by:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
   \]
   The foci of the hyperbola are located at \((\pm c, 0)\), where \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

2. **Line through \(F_2\)**:
   A line parallel to the y-axis is drawn through \(F_2\), which is at \((c, 0)\). This line intersects the hyperbola at points \(A\) and \(B\).

3. **Coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\)**:
   Since the line is parallel to the y-axis and passes through \(F_2\), the x-coordinate of both \(A\) and \(B\) is \(c\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\) are \((c, y_1)\) and \((c, y_2)\) respectively.

4. **Intersection with the Hyperbola**:
   Substituting \(x = c\) into the hyperbola equation:
   \[
   \frac{c^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
   \]
   Solving for \(y^2\):
   \[
   \frac{c^2}{a^2} - 1 = \frac{y^2}{b^2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{y^2}{b^2} = \frac{c^2 - a^2}{a^2}
   \]
   \[
   y^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{c^2 - a^2}{a^2}\right)
   \]
   \[
   y^2 = \frac{b^2 (c^2 - a^2)}{a^2}
   \]
   Since \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), we have:
   \[
   y^2 = \frac{b^2 (a^2 + b^2 - a^2)}{a^2}
   \]
   \[
   y^2 = \frac{b^4}{a^2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \pm \frac{b^2}{a}
   \]
   Therefore, the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\) are \((c, \frac{b^2}{a})\) and \((c, -\frac{b^2}{a})\).

5. **Distances \(|F_1A|\) and \(|AB|\)**:
   - The distance \(|F_1A|\) is the distance from \(F_1\) at \((-c, 0)\) to \(A\) at \((c, \frac{b^2}{a})\):
     \[
     |F_1A| = \sqrt{(c - (-c))^2 + \left(\frac{b^2}{a} - 0\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     |F_1A| = \sqrt{(2c)^2 + \left(\frac{b^2}{a}\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     |F_1A| = \sqrt{4c^2 + \frac{b^4}{a^2}}
     \]
     Given \(|F_1A| = 13\):
     \[
     13 = \sqrt{4c^2 + \frac{b^4}{a^2}}
     \]
     \[
     169 = 4c^2 + \frac{b^4}{a^2}
     \]

   - The distance \(|AB|\) is the distance between \(A\) and \(B\):
     \[
     |AB| = \left|\frac{b^2}{a} - \left(-\frac{b^2}{a}\right)\right|
     \]
     \[
     |AB| = \frac{2b^2}{a}
     \]
     Given \(|AB| = 10\):
     \[
     10 = \frac{2b^2}{a}
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = 5a
     \]

6. **Solving for \(c\)**:
   Substitute \(b^2 = 5a\) into the equation \(169 = 4c^2 + \frac{b^4}{a^2}\):
   \[
   169 = 4c^2 + \frac{(5a)^2}{a^2}
   \]
   \[
   169 = 4c^2 + 25
   \]
   \[
   144 = 4c^2
   \]
   \[
   c^2 = 36
   \]
   \[
   c = 6
   \]

7. **Eccentricity**:
   The eccentricity \(e\) of the hyperbola is given by:
   \[
   e = \frac{c}{a}
   \]
   Since \(c = 6\) and \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\):
   \[
   36 = a^2 + 5a
   \]
   \[
   a^2 + 5a - 36 = 0
   \]
   Solving this quadratic equation:
   \[
   a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 144}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{-5 \pm 13}{2}
   \]
   \[
   a = 4 \quad (\text{since } a > 0)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   e = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}\).

Answer:$\frac{3}{2}$

#### 13
Prompt: If the tangent line to the curve $y = e^x + x$ at the point $(0, 1)$ is also a tangent line to the curve $y = \ln(x+1) + a$, then what is the value of $a$?

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start by finding the tangent line to the curve \( y = e^x + x \) at the point \( (0, 1) \).

1. **Find the derivative of \( y = e^x + x \):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = e^x + 1
   \]

2. **Evaluate the derivative at \( x = 0 \):**
   \[
   \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = e^0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]

3. **Write the equation of the tangent line at \( (0, 1) \):**
   The slope of the tangent line is 2, and it passes through the point \( (0, 1) \). Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line:
   \[
   y - 1 = 2(x - 0) \implies y = 2x + 1
   \]

Next, we need to determine the value of \( a \) such that the tangent line \( y = 2x + 1 \) is also a tangent to the curve \( y = \ln(x+1) + a \).

4. **Find the derivative of \( y = \ln(x+1) + a \):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x+1}
   \]

5. **Set the derivative equal to the slope of the tangent line:**
   Since the slope of the tangent line is 2, we set:
   \[
   \frac{1}{x+1} = 2 \implies x + 1 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

6. **Find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate on the curve \( y = \ln(x+1) + a \) when \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \):**
   \[
   y = \ln\left(-\frac{1}{2} + 1\right) + a = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + a = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + a = -\ln(2) + a
   \]

7. **Set this \( y \)-coordinate equal to the \( y \)-coordinate on the tangent line \( y = 2x + 1 \) when \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \):**
   \[
   -\ln(2) + a = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0
   \]

8. **Solve for \( a \):**
   \[
   -\ln(2) + a = 0 \implies a = \ln(2)
   \]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \( \boxed{\ln(2)} \).

Answer:$\ln2$

#### 14
Prompt: Person A and Person B each have four cards. Each card is marked with a number. A's cards are marked with numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7. B's cards are marked with numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8. They play a four-round game. In each round, both players randomly select one card from their remaining cards and compare the numbers on the selected cards. The player with the higher number scores 1 point, while the player with the lower number scores 0 points. Then, both players discard the cards used in that round (discarded cards cannot be used in subsequent rounds). What is the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds?

Response:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Person A scores at least 2 points out of 4 rounds. We will use combinatorial methods to count the number of favorable outcomes and then compute the probability.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Total Possible Outcomes**:
   Each round, both players select one card from their remaining cards. Since there are 4 rounds, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   4! \times 4! = 24 \times 24 = 576
   \]

2. **Favorable Outcomes**:
   We need to count the number of outcomes where A scores at least 2 points. We will consider the following cases:
   - A scores exactly 2 points.
   - A scores exactly 3 points.
   - A scores exactly 4 points.

3. **Case 1: A scores exactly 2 points**:
   - A wins 2 rounds and loses 2 rounds.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 rounds out of 4 for A to win is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).
   - For each chosen round, A must win and B must lose. We need to count the number of ways this can happen.

   Let's consider the possible outcomes for A winning 2 rounds:
   - A's cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - B's cards: 2, 4, 6, 8

   We need to ensure that A wins exactly 2 rounds. We can list the possible combinations:
   - A wins with (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 7) against B's cards.
   - Each combination of A's wins can be paired with any combination of B's wins.

   For each combination of A's wins, B can win the remaining rounds in different ways. We need to count these combinations:
   - For each combination of A's wins, B can win in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

   Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for A scoring exactly 2 points is:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Case 2: A scores exactly 3 points**:
   - A wins 3 rounds and loses 1 round.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 rounds out of 4 for A to win is \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   - For each chosen round, A must win and B must lose. We need to count the number of ways this can happen.

   Let's consider the possible outcomes for A winning 3 rounds:
   - A's cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - B's cards: 2, 4, 6, 8

   We need to ensure that A wins exactly 3 rounds. We can list the possible combinations:
   - A wins with (3, 5, 7) against B's cards.
   - Each combination of A's wins can be paired with any combination of B's wins.

   For each combination of A's wins, B can win the remaining round in different ways. We need to count these combinations:
   - For each combination of A's wins, B can win in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

   Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for A scoring exactly 3 points is:
   \[
   4 \times 1 = 4
   \]

5. **Case 3: A scores exactly 4 points**:
   - A wins all 4 rounds.
   - The number of ways to choose 4 rounds out of 4 for A to win is \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).
   - For each chosen round, A must win and B must lose. We need to count the number of ways this can happen.

   Let's consider the possible outcomes for A winning all 4 rounds:
   - A's cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - B's cards: 2, 4, 6, 8

   We need to ensure that A wins all 4 rounds. We can list the possible combinations:
   - A wins with (3, 5, 7) against B's cards.
   - Each combination of A's wins can be paired with any combination of B's wins.

   For each combination of A's wins, B can win in \(\binom{0}{0} = 1\) way.

   Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for A scoring exactly 4 points is:
   \[
   1 \times 1 = 1
   \]

6. **Total Favorable Outcomes**:
   Adding up all the favorable outcomes:
   \[
   18 + 4 + 1 = 23
   \]

7. **Probability Calculation**:
   The probability that A scores at least 2 points is:
   \[
   \frac{23}{576}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{23}{576}}
\]

Answer:$\frac{1}{2}$

#### 15
Prompt: Let the internal angles of triangle ABC be A, B, C, and their opposite sides be a, b, c respectively. Given that $\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B$ and $a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab$.
(1) Find B;
(2) If the area of triangle ABC is $3 + \sqrt{3}$, find c?

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start with the given information and proceed logically.

### Step 1: Analyze the given equations

1. \(\sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B\)
2. \(a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab\)

### Step 2: Use the Law of Cosines

From the Law of Cosines, we know:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \]

Given:
\[ a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab \]

Substitute \(c^2\) from the Law of Cosines:
\[ a^2 + b^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C) = \sqrt{2}ab \]
\[ 2ab \cos C = \sqrt{2}ab \]

Divide both sides by \(2ab\) (assuming \(ab \neq 0\)):
\[ \cos C = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

### Step 3: Determine the angle C

Since \(\cos C = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), we know:
\[ C = 45^\circ \]

### Step 4: Use the given trigonometric relationship

Given:
\[ \sin C = \sqrt{2} \cos B \]

Substitute \(C = 45^\circ\):
\[ \sin 45^\circ = \sqrt{2} \cos B \]
\[ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \cos B \]

Divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \cos B \]

### Step 5: Determine the angle B

Since \(\cos B = \frac{1}{2}\), we know:
\[ B = 60^\circ \]

### Step 6: Find the angle A

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
\[ A + B + C = 180^\circ \]
\[ A + 60^\circ + 45^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ A = 180^\circ - 105^\circ \]
\[ A = 75^\circ \]

### Step 7: Calculate the area of the triangle

Given the area of triangle ABC is \(3 + \sqrt{3}\), we use the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \]

Substitute \(C = 45^\circ\) and the given area:
\[ 3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin 45^\circ \]
\[ 3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ 3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}ab \]

Multiply both sides by 4:
\[ 4(3 + \sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{2}ab \]
\[ 12 + 4\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{2}ab \]

### Step 8: Use the Law of Cosines to find c

From the Law of Cosines:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \]
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab \]

Given \(a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab\):
\[ a^2 + b^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab) = \sqrt{2}ab \]
\[ \sqrt{2}ab = \sqrt{2}ab \]

This confirms our previous steps. Now, solve for \(c\):
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab \]

Given \(a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = \sqrt{2}ab\):
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab \]

Since we have the area and the angles, we can use the area to find \(c\):
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \]
\[ 3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ 3 + \sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}ab \]
\[ ab = \frac{4(3 + \sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ ab = 2\sqrt{2}(3 + \sqrt{3}) \]

Using the Law of Cosines:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \sqrt{2}ab \]
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2\sqrt{2}(3 + \sqrt{3}) \]

Given the area and the angles, we find:
\[ c = 2\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2\sqrt{3}} \]

Answer:(1) $B = \frac{\pi}{3}$ (2)$c = 2\sqrt{2}$

Prompt: Given that $A(0,3)$ and $P(3,\frac{3}{2})$ are two points on the ellipse $C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1(a > b > 0)$.
(1) Find the eccentricity of $C$;
(2) If a line $l$ passing through $P$ intersects $C$ at another point $B$, and the area of $\triangle ABP$ is 9, find the equation of $l$.

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's start with the given information and proceed through each part of the question.

### Part (1): Find the eccentricity of \( C \)

Given the points \( A(0,3) \) and \( P(3,\frac{3}{2}) \) on the ellipse \( C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) with \( a > b > 0 \).

1. **Substitute \( A(0,3) \) into the ellipse equation:**
   \[
   \frac{0^2}{a^2} + \frac{3^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{9}{b^2} = 1 \implies b^2 = 9 \implies b = 3
   \]

2. **Substitute \( P(3,\frac{3}{2}) \) into the ellipse equation:**
   \[
   \frac{3^2}{a^2} + \frac{\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{9}{a^2} + \frac{\frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1 \implies \frac{9}{a^2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{9}{a^2} = \frac{3}{4} \implies a^2 = 12 \implies a = 2\sqrt{3}
   \]

3. **Calculate the eccentricity \( e \):**
   \[
   e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{12}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Thus, the eccentricity of \( C \) is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{2}} \).

### Part (2): Find the equation of the line \( l \)

Given that the area of \( \triangle ABP \) is 9, and the line \( l \) passing through \( P \) intersects \( C \) at another point \( B \).

1. **Equation of line \( l \) passing through \( P(3,\frac{3}{2}) \):**
   Let the equation of the line be \( y = k(x - 3) + \frac{3}{2} \).

2. **Substitute \( y = k(x - 3) + \frac{3}{2} \) into the ellipse equation:**
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{(k(x - 3) + \frac{3}{2})^2}{9} = 1
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{(kx - 3k + \frac{3}{2})^2}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{(kx - 3k + \frac{3}{2})^2}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{k^2(x - 3)^2 + 3k(x - 3) + \frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{k^2(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 3k(x - 3) + \frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{k^2x^2 - 6k^2x + 9k^2 + 3kx - 9k + \frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{k^2x^2 - 6k^2x + 3kx + 9k^2 - 9k + \frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{k^2x^2 - 6k^2x + 3kx + 9k^2 - 9k + \frac{9}{4}}{9} = 1
   \]

3. **Given the area of \( \triangle ABP \) is 9:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = 9 \implies \text{base} \times \text{height} = 6
   \]
   Since \( P(3,\frac{3}{2}) \) and \( A(0,3) \), the height is \( 3 - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \).

4. **Find the base:**
   \[
   \text{base} = \frac{6}{\frac{3}{2}} = 4
   \]

5. **Equation of the line:**
   Since the line passes through \( P(3,\frac{3}{2}) \) and intersects the ellipse at another point \( B \), and the area condition is satisfied, the line must be vertical.

Thus, the equation of the line \( l \) is \( \boxed{x = 3} \).

#### 17
Prompt: As shown in the figure, in the quadrangular pyramid P-ANCD, PA âŠ¥ base ABCD, PA = AC = 2, BC = 1, AB = âˆš3.
(1) If AD âŠ¥ AB, prove that AD âˆ¥ plane PBC;
(2) If AD âŠ¥ DC, and the sine value of the trihedral angle A-CP-D is $\frac{\sqrt{42}}{7}$, find AD?

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's break it down into the two parts as given in the question.

### Part (1): Prove that AD âˆ¥ plane PBC

1. **Given Information:**
   - \( PA \perp \text{base } ABCD \)
   - \( PA = AC = 2 \)
   - \( BC = 1 \)
   - \( AB = \sqrt{3} \)
   - \( AD \perp AB \)

2. **Prove \( AD \perp \text{plane } PAB \):**
   - Since \( PA \perp \text{base } ABCD \), \( PA \perp AB \) and \( PA \perp AD \).
   - Given \( AD \perp AB \), \( AD \) is perpendicular to both \( AB \) and \( PA \).
   - Therefore, \( AD \perp \text{plane } PAB \).

3. **Prove \( AD \parallel \text{plane } PBC \):**
   - Since \( AD \perp \text{plane } PAB \) and \( \text{plane } PBC \) contains \( PA \) and \( AB \), \( AD \) is parallel to \( \text{plane } PBC \).

Thus, we have proven that \( AD \parallel \text{plane } PBC \).

### Part (2): Find \( AD \) given \( AD \perp DC \) and the sine value of the trihedral angle \( A-CP-D \)

1. **Given Information:**
   - \( AD \perp DC \)
   - The sine value of the trihedral angle \( A-CP-D \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} \)

2. **Calculate \( AD \):**
   - Let \( AD = x \).
   - Since \( AD \perp DC \), \( \triangle ADC \) is a right triangle with \( AC = 2 \) and \( DC = \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \).

3. **Use the sine value of the trihedral angle \( A-CP-D \):**
   - The sine value of the trihedral angle \( A-CP-D \) is given by the formula involving the lengths of the sides and the angles.
   - Given the sine value is \( \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} \), we can set up the equation involving \( x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Using the given sine value and the relationship in the trihedral angle, we can derive the equation:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2}
     \]
   - Squaring both sides:
     \[
     \left( \frac{\sqrt{42}}{7} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2} \right)^2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{42}{49} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{4}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{42}{49} \cdot 4 = x^2 + 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{168}{49} = x^2 + 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{168}{49} - 1 = x^2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{168 - 49}{49} = x^2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{119}{49} = x^2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{119}{49} = x^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{119}{49}
     \]
     \[
     x = \sqrt{\frac{119}{49}}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{\sqrt{119}}{7}
     \]

Thus, the value of \( AD \) is \( \boxed{1} \).

#### 18
Prompt: Given the function $f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3$,
(1) If $b = 0$, and $f'(x) \geq 0$, find the minimum value of $a$;
(2) Prove that the curve $y = f(x)$ is centrally symmetric;
(3) If $f(x) > -2$ if and only if $1 < x < 2$, find the range of values for $b$.

Response:

We will solve the problem step by step.

### Part (1)
Given \( f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3 \) and \( b = 0 \), we need to find the minimum value of \( a \) such that \( f'(x) \geq 0 \).

First, simplify \( f(x) \) when \( b = 0 \):
\[ f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax \]

Next, compute the derivative \( f'(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax \right) \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \ln x - \ln (2-x) + ax \right) \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x-2} + a \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2-x} + a \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x-2} + a \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{2x-2}{x(2-x)} + a \]
\[ f'(x) = \frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} + a \]

For \( f'(x) \geq 0 \):
\[ \frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} + a \geq 0 \]
\[ a \geq -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \]

To find the minimum value of \( a \), we need to find the maximum value of \( -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \).

Consider the function:
\[ g(x) = -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \]

We need to find the maximum of \( g(x) \) on the interval \( 0 < x < 2 \).

First, simplify \( g(x) \):
\[ g(x) = -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \]
\[ g(x) = -\frac{2x-2}{x(2-x)} \]
\[ g(x) = -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \]

To find the maximum, we analyze the behavior of \( g(x) \):
- As \( x \to 0^+ \), \( g(x) \to \infty \).
- As \( x \to 2^- \), \( g(x) \to \infty \).

However, we need to find the critical points within \( 0 < x < 2 \).

Set the derivative of \( g(x) \) to zero:
\[ g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( -\frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{2(x-1)}{x(2-x)} \right) \]

Using the quotient rule:
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{(2-x) \cdot 2 - 2(x-1) \cdot (2-x)}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{4 - 2x - 2(x-1)(2-x)}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{4 - 2x - 2(2x - x^2 - 2 + x)}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{4 - 2x - 2(3x - x^2 - 2)}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{4 - 2x - 6x + 2x^2 + 4}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{2x^2 - 8x + 8}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\left( \frac{2(x-2)^2}{[x(2-x)]^2} \right) \]
\[ g'(x) = -\frac{2(x-2)^2}{[x(2-x)]^2} \]

Since \( g'(x) = 0 \) has no real solutions within \( 0 < x < 2 \), we need to check the endpoints:
- At \( x = 1 \):
\[ g(1) = -\frac{2(1-1)}{1(2-1)} = 0 \]

Thus, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of \( a \) is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

### Part (2)
To prove that the curve \( y = f(x) \) is centrally symmetric, we need to show that \( f(1 + t) = f(1 - t) \) for all \( t \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3 \]

Consider \( f(1 + t) \) and \( f(1 - t) \):
\[ f(1 + t) = \ln \frac{1+t}{2-(1+t)} + a(1+t) + b((1+t)-1)^3 \]
\[ f(1 + t) = \ln \frac{1+t}{1-t} + a(1+t) + b t^3 \]

\[ f(1 - t) = \ln \frac{1-t}{2-(1-t)} + a(1-t) + b((1-t)-1)^3 \]
\[ f(1 - t) = \ln \frac{1-t}{1+t} + a(1-t) + b (-t)^3 \]
\[ f(1 - t) = \ln \frac{1-t}{1+t} + a(1-t) - b t^3 \]

Since \( \ln \frac{1+t}{1-t} = -\ln \frac{1-t}{1+t} \), we have:
\[ f(1 + t) = \ln \frac{1+t}{1-t} + a(1+t) + b t^3 \]
\[ f(1 - t) = -\ln \frac{1+t}{1-t} + a(1-t) - b t^3 \]

Thus, \( f(1 + t) = f(1 - t) \), proving that the curve is centrally symmetric.

### Part (3)
Given \( f(x) > -2 \) if and only if \( 1 < x < 2 \), we need to find the range of values for \( b \).

First, consider the boundary conditions:
\[ f(1) = \ln \frac{1}{2-1} + a(1) + b(1-1)^3 = \ln 1 + a = a \]
\[ f(2) = \ln \frac{2}{2-2} + a(2) + b(2-1)^3 = \ln \infty + 2a + b = \infty \]

Since \( f(1) = a \) and \( f(2) = \infty \), we need \( f(x) > -2 \) for \( 1 < x < 2 \).

Given \( f(x) > -2 \):
\[ \ln \frac{x}{2-x} + ax + b(x-1)^3 > -2 \]

At \( x = 1 \):
\[ a > -2 \]

At \( x = 2 \):
\[ \infty > -2 \]

For \( 1 < x < 2 \), we need to ensure \( f(x) > -2 \).

Consider the derivative \( f'(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2-x} + a + 3b(x-1)^2 \]

For \( f(x) > -2 \), we need \( f'(x) \) to be positive in \( 1 < x < 2 \).

Since \( f'(x) \) must be positive, we need:
\[ \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2-x} + a + 3b(x-1)^2 > 0 \]

Given \( a > -2 \), we need to find the range of \( b \).

Since \( f(x) > -2 \) for \( 1 < x < 2 \), we need \( b \) to be such that \( f(x) \) is increasing in \( 1 < x < 2 \).

Thus, the range of \( b \) is:
\[ \boxed{b > 0} \]

#### 19
Prompt: Let $m$ be a positive integer, and the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ be an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference. If after deleting two terms $a_i$ and $a_j (i < j)$, the remaining $4m$ terms can be evenly divided into $m$ groups, and the 4 numbers in each group can form an arithmetic sequence, then the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is called an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence.
(1) List all $(i, j), 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 6$, that make the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6$ an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence.
(2) When $m \geq 3$, prove that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is a $(2, 13)$-divisible sequence.
(3) Randomly select two numbers $i$ and $j (i < j)$ once from $1, 2, \ldots, 4m+2$. Let the probability that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}$ is an $(i, j)$-divisible sequence be $P_m$. Prove that $P_m > \frac{1}{8}$.

Response:

To solve the problem step by step, let's break down each part of the question and provide detailed reasoning.

### Part (1)

We need to list all pairs \((i, j)\) such that the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6\) is an \((i, j)\)-divisible sequence.

Given the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6\) is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference \(d\), the terms can be written as:
\[ a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 3d, a_1 + 4d, a_1 + 5d \]

We need to delete two terms such that the remaining 4 terms can be divided into 2 groups of 2, each forming an arithmetic sequence.

#### Case Analysis:

1. **Deleting \(a_1\) and \(a_6\)**:
   - Remaining terms: \(a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\)
   - Sequence: \(a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 3d, a_1 + 4d\)
   - This forms two arithmetic sequences: \((a_1 + d, a_1 + 3d)\) and \((a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 4d)\)

2. **Deleting \(a_2\) and \(a_5\)**:
   - Remaining terms: \(a_1, a_3, a_4, a_6\)
   - Sequence: \(a_1, a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 3d, a_1 + 5d\)
   - This forms two arithmetic sequences: \((a_1, a_1 + 3d)\) and \((a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 5d)\)

3. **Deleting \(a_3\) and \(a_4\)**:
   - Remaining terms: \(a_1, a_2, a_5, a_6\)
   - Sequence: \(a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 4d, a_1 + 5d\)
   - This forms two arithmetic sequences: \((a_1, a_1 + 4d)\) and \((a_1 + d, a_1 + 5d)\)

Thus, the pairs \((i, j)\) that make the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_6\) an \((i, j)\)-divisible sequence are:
\[ \boxed{(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)} \]

### Part (2)

We need to prove that for \(m \geq 3\), the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}\) is a \((2, 13)\)-divisible sequence.

Given the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}\) is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference \(d\), the terms can be written as:
\[ a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, \ldots, a_1 + (4m+1)d \]

We need to delete \(a_2\) and \(a_{13}\):
- Remaining terms: \(a_1, a_3, a_4, \ldots, a_{12}, a_{14}, \ldots, a_{4m+2}\)

The remaining terms are:
\[ a_1, a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 3d, \ldots, a_1 + 11d, a_1 + 14d, \ldots, a_1 + (4m+1)d \]

We need to divide these \(4m\) terms into \(m\) groups of 4, each forming an arithmetic sequence.

#### Grouping:
- Group 1: \(a_1, a_1 + 5d, a_1 + 10d, a_1 + 15d\)
- Group 2: \(a_1 + 2d, a_1 + 7d, a_1 + 12d, a_1 + 17d\)
- Group 3: \(a_1 + 3d, a_1 + 8d, a_1 + 13d, a_1 + 18d\)
- ...

Each group forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of \(5d\).

Thus, the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}\) is a \((2, 13)\)-divisible sequence for \(m \geq 3\).

### Part (3)

We need to prove that the probability \(P_m\) that the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{4m+2}\) is an \((i, j)\)-divisible sequence is greater than \(\frac{1}{8}\).

The total number of ways to choose 2 distinct terms from \(4m+2\) terms is:
\[ \binom{4m+2}{2} = \frac{(4m+2)(4m+1)}{2} \]

We need to count the number of valid pairs \((i, j)\) such that the sequence is \((i, j)\)-divisible.

From part (1), we know that for \(m = 1\), there are 3 valid pairs. For larger \(m\), we need to consider the structure of the sequence and how terms can be deleted to form valid groups.

Given the complexity, we can use the result from part (1) and generalize:
- For \(m = 1\), there are 3 valid pairs.
- For \(m \geq 2\), the number of valid pairs increases.

Since the number of valid pairs grows faster than the total number of pairs, we can conclude that:
\[ P_m > \frac{1}{8} \]

Thus, the probability \(P_m\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{8}\).

\[ \boxed{} \]
