Prompt: 设全集 $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$，集合 $A=\{2,4\}$，求 $\bar{A}$？

Response:

assistant

A simple one! 😊

To find the complement of set $A$, we need to find all elements in the universal set $U$ that are not in set $A$.

In this case, $A = \{2, 4\}$, so all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$ are:

$$\bar{A} = U - A = \{1, 3, 5\}$$

So, the complement of set $A$ is $\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}$. 👍

Answer:$\{1,3,5\}$

Prompt: 已知 $x \in R$，$x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$ 的解集为？

Response:

assistant

We can rewrite the inequality as $(x-3)(x+1)<0$. This is true when $x\in(-1,3)$, so the solution set is $\boxed{(-1,3)}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is (-1,3). I hope it is correct.

Answer:$(-1,3)$

#### 4
Prompt: 已知 $F(x) = x^3 + a$，已知 $F(x)$ 是奇函数，$x \in R$，$a=$？

Response:

assistant

A nice problem! 😊

Since $F(x)$ is an odd function, we know that:

$$F(-x) = -F(x)$$

Substitute $x$ with $-x$ in the original function:

$$F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a = -x^3 + a$$

Now, equate this with the negation of $F(x)$:

$$-F(x) = -x^3 + a$$

Simplify:

$$F(x) = x^3 - a$$

Compare this with the original function:

$$x^3 + a = x^3 - a$$

Add $a$ to both sides:

$$a = 0$$

So, the value of $a$ is $\boxed{0}$. 🎉

Answer:$0$

#### 5
Prompt: 已知 $k \in R$，$\vec{a}=(2,5)$，$\vec{b}=(6,k)$，$\vec{a}//\vec{b}$，则 $k$ 的值为？

Response:

assistant

Since $\vec{a} // \vec{b}$, we know that $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are parallel vectors. This means that they have the same direction and slope.

The slope of $\vec{a}$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, and the slope of $\vec{b}$ is $\frac{k}{6}$. Since they are parallel, we can set these two slopes equal to each other:

$$\frac{5}{2} = \frac{k}{6}$$

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$$5 \cdot 6 = 2k$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$30 = 2k$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$k = \boxed{15}$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 15.

Answer:$15$

#### 6
Prompt: 在 $(x+1)^n$ 的二项展开式中，若各项系数和为 32，则 $x^2$ 项的系数为？

Response:

assistant

Let's denote the coefficient of $x^2$ in the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$ as $a$. Then, we know that the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion is 32, i.e.

$$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 32.$$Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is $\binom{n}{2} = a$, we can rewrite the above equation as:

$$a + \sum_{k=0, k\neq2}^n \binom{n}{k} = 32.$$Note that the term $\binom{n}{2}$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, which is $a$. The other terms in the sum are the coefficients of $x^0, x, x^3, \ldots, x^n$, which are all non-zero.

Since the sum of all the coefficients is 32, the sum of the coefficients of $x^0, x, x^3, \ldots, x^n$ must be 32 minus the coefficient of $x^2$, i.e.

$$\sum_{k=0, k\neq2}^n \binom{n}{k} = 32 - a.$$Substituting this into the original equation, we get:

$$a + (32 - a) = 32 \Rightarrow a = \boxed{16}.$$
Final Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.

Answer:$10$

#### 7
Prompt: 已知抛物线 $y^2=4x$ 上有一点 $P$ 到准线的距离为 9， 那么 $P$ 到 $x$ 轴的距离为？

Response:

assistant

Let the point $P$ be $(x_0, y_0)$. Since $P$ lies on the parabola $y^2 = 4x$, we have $y_0^2 = 4x_0$.

The distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis is $y_0$. The distance from $P$ to the vertical line $x = x_0$ is $|x_0 - x_0| = 0$.

The distance from $P$ to the vertical line $x = x_0$ is the same as the distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis:

$$9^2 = y_0^2 + 0^2 \Rightarrow y_0^2 = 81$$

Since $y_0^2 = 4x_0$, we can substitute $y_0^2 = 81$ into the equation to get:

$$81 = 4x_0 \Rightarrow x_0 = 20.5$$

So, the distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis is $y_0 = \boxed{\sqrt{81} = 9}$.

Answer:$4\sqrt{2}$

Prompt: 某校举办科学竞技比赛，有 $A$，$B$，$C$ 三种题库，$A$ 题库有 5000 道题，$B$ 题库有 4000 道题，$C$ 题库有 3000 道题。小申已完成所有题，他 $A$ 题库的正确率是 0.92，B 题库的正确率是 0.86，C 题库的正确率是 0.72。现他从所有的题中随即选一题，正确率是？

Response:

assistant

Let's calculate the total number of questions:

A: 5000
B: 4000
C: 3000
Total: 5000 + 4000 + 3000 = 12000

The number of correct answers for each question bank is:

A: 5000 × 0.92 = 4600
B: 4000 × 0.86 = 3440
C: 3000 × 0.72 = 2160

The total number of correct answers is:

4600 + 3440 + 2160 = 10200

The probability of choosing a correct answer is:

10200 / 12000 = 0.85

So, the correct answer rate is 0.85.

Prompt: 已知虚数 $z$ ，其实部为 1，且 $z+\frac{2}{z}=m(m \in R)$，则实数 $m$ 为？

Response:

assistant

Let $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y \neq 0$. Then we have:

$$x + yi + \frac{2}{x + yi} = m$$

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

$$x + yi + \frac{x - yi}{x^2 + y^2} = m$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x + yi + \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} - \frac{yi}{x^2 + y^2} = m$$

$$x + \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} + yi - \frac{yi}{x^2 + y^2} = m$$

$$\frac{x^2 + y^2 + x}{x^2 + y^2} + yi = m$$

$$1 + \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} + yi = m$$

Since $y = 1$, we have:

$$1 + \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} + i = m$$

Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get:

$$1 + \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \Re(m)$$

$$i = \Im(m)$$

Since $m$ is a real number, $\Im(m) = 0$, which implies $i = 0$. This is a contradiction, since $y = 1$.

Therefore, there is no real number $m$ that satisfies the given equation.

Note: The equation $z + \frac{2}{z} = m$ has no real solution, because it is equivalent to $z^2 - mz + 2 = 0$, which is a quadratic equation with no real solutions if $m^2 < 4$.

Prompt: 设集合 $A$ 中的元素皆为无重复数字的三位正整数，且元素中任意两者之积皆为偶数，求集合中元素个数的最大值？

Prompt: 等比数列 $\{a_n\}$ 首项 $a_1>0$，$q>1$，记 $\ln=\{x-y|x,y\in[a_1,a_2]\cup[a_n,a_{n+1}]\}$，若对任意正整数 $n$，$\ln$ 是闭区间，则 $q$ 的范围是？

Response:

assistant

Since $\ln$ is a closed interval, it must contain its endpoints, i.e., $a_1$ and $a_n$ for all $n$. Since $a_1>0$, we have $\ln\supset[0,\infty)$. Since $q>1$, we have $\ln\supset(a_1,\infty)$.

Now, consider $a_n$ for some $n$. We have $\ln\supset[a_n,\infty)$, and since $q>1$, we have $\ln\supset(a_{n-1},\infty)$. Therefore, $\ln$ contains all intervals of the form $(a_k,\infty)$ for $k=1,2,\dots,n$. Since these intervals are disjoint, their union is $\ln\supset\bigcup_{k=1}^n(a_k,\infty)$. Since $q>1$, we have $\ln\supset\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty(a_k,\infty)$. Since this is a countable union of open intervals, $\ln$ is the union of all open intervals of the form $(a_k,\infty)$ for $k=1,2,\dots$. Therefore, $\ln=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty(a_k,\infty)$.

Now, we claim that $\ln$ is also a closed interval. Since $\ln$ is a countable union of open intervals, we only need to show that it is closed under taking limits. Let $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence in $\ln$ such that $x_n\to x$. Then, for each $n$, there exists $a_k$ such that $x_n\in(a_k,\infty)$. Since $x_n\to x$, we have $x\in\overline{(a_k,\infty)}=\{a_k\}\cup(a_k,\infty)$. Since $a_k$ is the only accumulation point of $(a_k,\infty)$, we have $x=a_k$ or $x\in(a_k,\infty)$. Since $x\in\ln$, we have $x\in\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty(a_k,\infty)$, and since $x=a_k$ or $x\in(a_k,\infty)$, we have $x\in\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty(a_k,\infty)$.

Therefore, $\ln$ is a closed interval, and since it contains all intervals of the form $(a_k,\infty)$, it must contain all accumulation points of these intervals, i.e., $a_k$ for all $k$. Therefore, $\ln$ contains all accumulation points of the sequence $(a_n)$, which is the same as the sequence itself. Therefore, $\ln=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty(a_k,\infty)=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty[a_k,\infty)$. Since $\ln$ is a closed interval, it must contain its endpoints, i.e., $a_1$ and $a_k$ for all $k$. Therefore, $\ln=[a_1,\infty)$.

Since $\ln$ is a closed interval, it must contain all accumulation points of the sequence $(a_n)$, which is the same as the sequence itself. Therefore, $\ln=[a_1,\infty)=[a_1,\infty)$, and since $a_1>0$, we have $\ln=[0,\infty)$. Therefore, the only possible value of $q$ is $\boxed{1}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.

According to the problem statement, the relationship between air temperature and sea surface temperature is positive, which means that as air temperature increases, sea surface temperature also tends to increase.

So, the correct answer is:

C. 随着气候温度由低到高，海水表层温度呈上升趋势 (As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature tends to increase.)

The other options are incorrect:

A. 气候温度高，海水表层温度就高 (This statement is too simplistic and doesn't consider the direction of the relationship.)

B. 气候温度高，海水表层温度就低 (This statement is opposite to the correct relationship.)

D. 随着气候温度由低到高，海水表层温度呈下降趋势 (This statement is the opposite of the correct relationship.)

Prompt: 下列函数 $f(x)$ 的最小正周期是 $2\pi$ 的是？ A. $\sin x + \cos x$ B. $\sin x \cos x$ C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$ D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

Response:

A nice trigonometry question! 😊

Let's analyze each option:

A. $\sin x + \cos x$:
This is a sum of two trigonometric functions, and the sum of two periodic functions with periods $2\pi$ and $2\pi$ is still periodic with period $2\pi$. So, this option is possible.

B. $\sin x \cos x$:
This is a product of two trigonometric functions, and the product of two periodic functions with periods $2\pi$ and $2\pi$ is not necessarily periodic with period $2\pi$. In fact, the product of two periodic functions with periods $2\pi$ can have a period of $\frac{2\pi}{m}$, where $m$ is an integer. So, this option is not necessarily correct.

C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$:
This is a sum of two squares of trigonometric functions, and the sum of two periodic functions with periods $2\pi$ and $2\pi$ is still periodic with period $2\pi$. So, this option is possible.

D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$:
This is a difference of two squares of trigonometric functions, and the difference of two periodic functions with periods $2\pi$ and $2\pi$ is still periodic with period $2\pi$. So, this option is possible.

After analyzing each option, we can conclude that the correct answers are:

A. $\sin x + \cos x$
C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$
D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

All three options are periodic with period $2\pi$, and therefore, they are all correct answers. 👏

Prompt: 定义一个集合 $\Omega$，集合元素是空间内的点集，任取 $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$，存在不完全为 0 的实数 $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$，使得 $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$。 已知 $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$，则 $(0,0,1) \not\in \Omega$ 的充分条件是？ A. $(0,0,0)$ B. $(-1,0,0)$ C. $(0,1,0)$ D. $(0,0,-1)$

Response:

A nice problem in linear algebra!

Let's denote the points in $\Omega$ as $P_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $P_3 = (x_3, y_3, z_3)$. The given condition states that there exist non-zero real numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that:

$$\lambda_1 \sqrt{(x_1-0)^2 + (y_1-0)^2 + (z_1-0)^2} + \lambda_2 \sqrt{(x_2-0)^2 + (y_2-0)^2 + (z_2-0)^2} + \lambda_3 \sqrt{(x_3-0)^2 + (y_3-0)^2 + (z_3-0)^2} = 0$$

We are given that $(1, 0, 0) \in \Omega$, so we can set $P_1 = (1, 0, 0)$. Then, the equation becomes:

$$\lambda_1 \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} + \lambda_2 \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2 + z_2^2} + \lambda_3 \sqrt{x_3^2 + y_3^2 + z_3^2} = 0$$

Since $\lambda_1 \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\lambda_1$ to get:

$$\sqrt{1} + \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2 + z_2^2} + \frac{\lambda_3}{\lambda_1} \sqrt{x_3^2 + y_3^2 + z_3^2} = 0$$

Now, we are asked to find the sufficient condition for $(0, 0, 1) \not\in \Omega$. To do this, we can set $P_2 = (0, 0, 1)$ and $P_3 = (x_3, y_3, z_3)$. The equation becomes:

$$1 + \frac{\lambda_3}{\lambda_1} \sqrt{x_3^2 + y_3^2 + 1^2} = 0$$

Since $\lambda_1 \neq 0$, we can multiply both sides by $\lambda_1$ to get:

$$\lambda_1 + \lambda_3 \sqrt{x_3^2 + y_3^2 + 1^2} = 0$$

Now, we can see that if $(0, 0, 1) \not\in \Omega$, then $\lambda_3 = 0$. But this would mean that the equation is satisfied only when $P_2 = (0, 0, 1)$, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, we can conclude that $(0, 0, 1) \not\in \Omega$ if and only if $\lambda_3 \neq 0$. This is equivalent to saying that $(0, 0, 1)$ is not a linear combination of $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(x_3, y_3, z_3)$.

Now, let's examine the options:

A. $(0, 0, 0)$: This point is a linear combination of $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 0)$, so it is in $\Omega$.

B. $(-1, 0, 0)$: This point is a linear combination of $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-2, 0, 0)$, so it is in $\Omega$.

C. $(0, 1, 0)$: This point is a linear combination of $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$, so it is in $\Omega$.

D. $(0, 0, -1)$: This point is not a linear combination of $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 0)$, so it is not in $\Omega$.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. $(0, 0, -1)$.

Answer:C

Response:

assistant

A nice problem! 😊

Let's analyze the set $M = \{x_0 | x_0 \in \mathbb{R}, x \in (-\infty, x_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$.

From the definition, we know that $f(x)$ is less than $f(x_0)$ for all $x < x_0$. This means that $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$.

Since $M = [-1, 1]$, we have $x_0 \in [-1, 1]$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$, where $x_0 \in [-1, 1]$.

Now, let's check each option:

A. $f(x)$ is an even function: Not necessarily true. For example, consider $f(x) = x$.

B. $f(x)$ takes its maximum value at $x = 2$: Not true. Since $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$, it cannot take its maximum value at $x = 2$, as $x = 2$ is not in the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$.

C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing: True! Since $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$, it is strictly increasing on this interval.

D. $f(x)$ takes its minimum value at $x = -1$: True! Since $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$, it must take its minimum value at the left endpoint of this interval, which is $x = -1$.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

* C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.
* D. $f(x)$ takes its minimum value at $x = -1$.

Response:

assistant

A nice problem! 😊

**(1)**

First, let's find the height of the tetrahedron. Since $AD = 3\sqrt{2}$ and $AP = 5$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:

$$AP^2 = AD^2 - AB^2 \Rightarrow AB^2 = AP^2 - AD^2 = 25 - 18 = 7$$

So, $AB = \sqrt{7}$. Since $O$ is the center of the square base, the height of the tetrahedron is $OH = \frac{1}{2}AB = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}$.

Now, we can find the volume of the tetrahedron:

$$V = \frac{1}{3}Bh = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)^2\cdot 5 = \frac{35\sqrt{7}}{24}$$

**(2)**

Let's denote the angle between $\overline{BD}$ and the plane $AEC$ as $\theta$. We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180° to find the angle between $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{AC}$:

$$\angle BEC + \angle ECA + \angle ACB = 180° \Rightarrow \angle BEC + 2\theta + 90° = 180°$$

Since $\angle BEC = 90°$ (right angle), we have:

$$2\theta = 90° \Rightarrow \theta = \boxed{45°}$$

So, the angle between $\overline{BD}$ and the plane $AEC$ is 45°. 👍

Response:

A nice logarithmic function problem! 😊

**(1) Find the solution set of $f(2x-2) < f(x)$**

We are given that $y = f(x) = \log_a x$. Since $f(4) = 2$, we know that $4 = a^2$, so $a = \sqrt{4} = 2$.

Now, we need to find the solution set of $f(2x-2) < f(x)$. Let's rewrite the inequality:

$$\log_a (2x-2) < \log_a x$$

By the change-of-base formula, we can rewrite this as:

$$\frac{\ln(2x-2)}{\ln a} < \frac{\ln x}{\ln a}$$

Since $\ln a = \ln 2$, we can simplify the inequality:

$$\ln(2x-2) < \ln x$$

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

$$2x-2 < x$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x > 2$$

So, the solution set is $\boxed{(2, \infty)}$.

**(2) Find the range of $a$ such that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, and $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence**

We are given that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, and $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence. This means that:

$$f(x+1) - f(ax) = f(x+2) - f(x+1)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\log_a(x+1) - \log_a(ax) = \log_a(x+2) - \log_a(x+1)$$

Using the property of logarithms that $\log_a x - \log_a y = \log_a \frac{x}{y}$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$\log_a \frac{x+1}{ax} = \log_a \frac{x+2}{x+1}$$

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

$$\frac{x+1}{ax} = \frac{x+2}{x+1}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x = a$$

So, the range of $a$ is $\boxed{(0, \infty)}$. Note that $a$ cannot be 1, since $a$ cannot be equal to 0.

Answer:(1) $(1,2)$ (2) $a>1$

Prompt: 为了了解某地初中学生体育锻炼时长与学业成绩的关系，从该地区 29000 名学生中抽取 580 人，得到日均体育锻炼时长与学业成绩的数据如下表所示：（1）该地区 29000 名学生中体育锻炼时长大于 1 小时人数约为多少？（2）估计该地区初中生日均体育锻炼的时长（精确到 0.1）？（3）是否有 0.95 的把握认为学业成绩优秀与日均体育锻炼时长不小于 1 小时且小于 2 小时有 $A$关？ 附： $\chi^2 = \frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$，$P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05$。

Response:

assistant

(1) 该地区 29000 名学生中体育锻炼时长大于 1 小时人数约为多少？

根据抽取的 580 人的数据，我们可以计算出体育锻炼时长大于 1 小时的人数约为：

（580-140-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90-100）/580≈ 12.7%

所以，该地区 29000 名学生中体育锻炼时长大于 1 小时的人数约为 3657 人（约为 12.7%）。

(2) 估计该地区初中生日均体育锻炼的时长（精确到 0.1）？

我们可以使用平均值来估计该地区初中生的日均体育锻炼的时长。根据数据，我们可以计算出：

平均体育锻炼时长 = (140*1+20*2+30*3+40*4+50*5+60*6+70*7+80*8+90*9+100*10)/580 ≈ 4.3

所以，估计该地区初中生的日均体育锻炼的时长为 4.3 小时（精确到 0.1）。

(3) 是否有 0.95 的把握认为学业成绩优秀与日均体育锻炼时长不小于 1 小时且小于 2 小时有关？

我们可以使用 Pearson 分数来测量学业成绩与日均体育锻炼时长之间的相关性。根据数据，我们可以计算出：

Pearson 分数 = (140*1+20*2+30*3+40*4+50*5+60*6+70*7+80*8+90*9+100*10) / (580*580) ≈ 0.25

由于 Pearson 分数小于 0.3，我们可以认为学业成绩与日均体育锻炼时长之间没有明显的相关性。

为了判断是否有 0.95 的把握认为学业成绩优秀与日均体育锻炼时长不小于 1 小时且小于 2 小时有关，我们可以使用χ²检验。首先，我们需要将数据分成四个组：

组 1：日均体育锻炼时长 < 1 小时
组 2：日均体育锻炼时长 ≥ 1 小时且 < 2 小时
组 3：日均体育锻炼时长 ≥ 2 小时且 < 3 小时
组 4：日均体育锻炼时长 ≥ 3 小时

然后，我们可以计算出每个组的频数和频率：

组 1：频数 = 140，频率 = 140/580 ≈ 0.241
组 2：频数 = 20，频率 = 20/580 ≈ 0.034
组 3：频数 = 30，频率 = 30/580 ≈ 0.052
组 4：频数 = 390，频率 = 390/580 ≈ 0.673

最后，我们可以计算出χ²值：

χ² = ((140-580*0.241)^2)/(580*0.241*0.759) + ((20-580*0.034)^2)/(580*0.034*0.966) + ((30-580*0.052)^2)/(580*0.052*0.948) + ((390-580*0.673)^2)/(580*0.673*0.327) ≈ 4.13

由于χ²值小于 3.841，我们可以 reject H0，认为学业成绩优秀与日均体育锻炼时长不小于 1 小时且小于 2 小时没有关。

A nice problem! 😊

**(1)** If $e=2$, we know that the eccentricity of the hyperbola is 2, which means that the distance from the center of the hyperbola to the focus is equal to the semi-major axis. In this case, the center of the hyperbola is $(0, 0)$, and the semi-major axis is $a = 1$. Therefore, the distance from the center to the focus is also 1, and the focal parameter is $c = 1$.

Using the formula for the eccentricity of a hyperbola, we get:

$$e = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{c}{a}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1}{1}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2}$$

Since $e=2$, we have a contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.

**(2)** If $b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$, we can use the formula for the distance from the center of the hyperbola to the vertex:

$$a = \frac{b^2}{\sqrt{b^2+4}}$$

Substituting the value of $b$, we get:

$$a = \frac{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\right)^2}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\right)^2+4}} = \frac{8}{3}$$

Since $M(-2, 0)$ lies on the hyperbola, we can use the equation of the hyperbola to find the coordinates of $P$:

$$(-2)^2 - \frac{0^2}{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\right)^2} = 1$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$4 - \frac{9}{4} = 1$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = -\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}$$

Since $P$ lies in the first quadrant, we know that $y>0$. Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are:

$$P\left(-\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}, \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)$$

**(3)** If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, we can use the formula for the dot product of two vectors:

$$\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = \lVert \vec{A_1R} \rVert \lVert \vec{A_2P} \rVert \cos \theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. Since the vectors are parallel to the axes, we know that $\theta$ is either 0 or $\pi$.

If $\theta=0$, then the vectors are collinear, and we have:

$$\vec{A_1R} = k \vec{A_2P}$$

for some constant $k$. Since $\vec{A_1R}$ and $\vec{A_2P}$ have the same direction, we know that the points $A_1$, $R$, and $P$ lie on the same line.

However, this is impossible since $R$ lies on the hyperbola and $P$ lies on the line $l$.

Therefore, we must have $\theta=\pi$, which means that the vectors are orthogonal. In this case, the dot product is equal to 0.

We can now use the formula for the dot product to find the value of $b$:

$$0 = \vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = \left(\sqrt{b^2+4}\right) \left(\sqrt{b^2+4}\right) \cos \pi$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$0 = b^2+4$$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = \pm 2$$

Therefore, the value of $b$ is either 2 or -2.

Response:

A nice set of problems! 😊

**(1)**
For $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, we have $D = (0, \infty)$ and $M = (1, 0)$. We need to find a point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$ that minimizes the function $s(x) = (x - a)^2 + (f(x) - b)^2$.

Taking the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$$s'(x) = 2(x - a) + 2(f(x) - b) \cdot (-1/x^2)$$

Setting $s'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$2(x - a) - 2(f(x) - b)/x = 0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (f(x) - b)x + (f(x) - b)^2 = 0$$

Since $f(x) = 1/x$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (1/x - b)x + (1/x - b)^2 = 0$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$x^3 - (2a + b)x^2 + (a^2 + b^2 + 1)x - ab = 0$$

This is a cubic equation in $x$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it has at least one real root. Since $s(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, the point $P$ that minimizes $s(x)$ must be a critical point of $s(x)$. Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a point $P$ that is the closest point to $M$ on the graph of $f(x) = 1/x$.

**(2)**
For $f(x) = e^x$, we have $D = R$ and $M = (1, 0)$. We need to find a point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$ that minimizes the function $s(x) = (x - a)^2 + (f(x) - b)^2$.

Taking the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$$s'(x) = 2(x - a) + 2(f(x) - b) \cdot e^x$$

Setting $s'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$2(x - a) + 2(f(x) - b) \cdot e^x = 0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (f(x) - b)^2 - 2(f(x) - b) = 0$$

Since $f(x) = e^x$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (e^x - b)^2 - 2(e^x - b) = 0$$

This is a transcendental equation in $x$. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a closed-form solution for this equation. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether there exists a point $P$ that is the closest point to $M$ on the graph of $f(x) = e^x$.

**(3)**
For the general function $f(x)$, let $M_1 = (t - 1, f(t) - g(t))$ and $M_2 = (t + 1, f(t) + g(t))$. We need to find a point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$ that minimizes the function $s(x) = (x - a)^2 + (f(x) - b)^2$.

Taking the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$$s'(x) = 2(x - a) + 2(f(x) - b) \cdot f'(x)$$

Setting $s'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$2(x - a) + 2(f(x) - b) \cdot f'(x) = 0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (f(x) - b)^2 - 2(f(x) - b) \cdot f'(x) = 0$$

Since $g(x)$ is positive and $f'(x)$ exists, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - (f(x) - b)^2 - 2g(x) \cdot f'(x) = 0$$

This is a transcendental equation in $x$. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a closed-form solution for this equation. However, we can make some observations:

* Since $g(x)$ is positive, the term $-2g(x) \cdot f'(x)$ is negative.
* Since $f'(x)$ exists, the term $-2g(x) \cdot f'(x)$ is bounded.
* Since $s(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, the point $P$ that minimizes $s(x)$ must be a critical point of $s(x)$.

Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a point $P$ that is the closest point to $M_1$ on the graph of $f(x)$, and also the closest point to $M_2$ on the graph of $f(x)$.

Now, let's consider the monotonicity of $f(x)$. Since $P$ is a critical point of $s(x)$, we know that $f'(x_0) = 0$. Since $g(x)$ is positive, we have:

$$f'(x_0) = 0 \Rightarrow f''(x_0) = 0$$

This implies that $f(x)$ is concave up at $x_0$. Since $P$ is a critical point of $s(x)$, we know that $f(x)$ is concave up on some interval containing $x_0$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(x)$ is non-decreasing on some interval containing $x_0$.
