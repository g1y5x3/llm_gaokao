Prompt: 设全集 $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$，集合 $A=\{2,4\}$，求 $\bar{A}$？

Response:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The universal set $U$ is given as $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
2. The set $A$ is given as $A = \{2, 4\}$.
3. The complement of $A$, denoted by $\bar{A}$, is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.
4. To find $\bar{A}$, we need to identify the elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.
5. The elements in $U$ that are not in $A$ are $\{1, 3, 5\}$.
6. Therefore, the complement of $A$ is $\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}$.

So, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}}$$

Answer:$\{1,3,5\}$

#### 2
Prompt: 已知 $f(x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{x}, x > 0 \\1, x \leq 0\end{cases}$，$f(3)=$？

Response:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We are given the function $f(x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{x}, x > 0 \\1, x \leq 0\end{cases}$
2. We want to find the value of $f(3)$
3. Since $3 > 0$, we use the first part of the piecewise definition: $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$
4. Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation: $f(3) = \sqrt{3}$
5. Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}$

Answer:$\sqrt{3}$

#### 3
Prompt: 已知 $x \in R$，$x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$ 的解集为？

Response:

Let's solve the inequality step by step.

Given: $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$

Step 1: Factor the quadratic expression:

$x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0$

Step 2: Analyze the factors:

We have two factors: $(x - 3)$ and $(x + 1)$. For the product to be negative, one of the factors must be positive and the other must be negative.

Case 1: $(x - 3) > 0$ and $(x + 1) < 0$
This implies $x > 3$ and $x < -1$, which is impossible since $x$ cannot be both greater than 3 and less than -1.

Case 2: $(x - 3) < 0$ and $(x + 1) > 0$
This implies $x < 3$ and $x > -1$, which is possible.

Step 3: Find the solution set:

From Case 2, we have $-1 < x < 3$. Therefore, the solution set is:

$\boxed{(-1, 3)}$

So, the solution set is the open interval $(-1, 3)$.

Answer:$(-1,3)$

#### 4
Prompt: 已知 $F(x) = x^3 + a$，已知 $F(x)$ 是奇函数，$x \in R$，$a=$？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Since $F(x)$ is an odd function, we know that $F(-x) = -F(x)$ for all $x \in R$.
2. We are given that $F(x) = x^3 + a$. Let's substitute $-x$ for $x$ to get $F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a = -x^3 + a$.
3. Since $F(-x) = -F(x)$, we can set up the equation: $-x^3 + a = -F(x) = -(x^3 + a)$.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: $-x^3 + a = -x^3 - a$.
5. Since this equation holds for all $x \in R$, we can equate the coefficients of $x^3$ and the constant terms separately.
6. Equating the coefficients of $x^3$, we get: $-1 = -1$, which is true.
7. Equating the constant terms, we get: $a = -a$.
8. The only solution to this equation is $a = 0$.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{a = 0}$.

So, the odd function $F(x)$ is simply $F(x) = x^3$.

Answer:$0$

#### 5
Prompt: 已知 $k \in R$，$\vec{a}=(2,5)$，$\vec{b}=(6,k)$，$\vec{a}//\vec{b}$，则 $k$ 的值为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are parallel, we know that their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. In other words, there exists a scalar $t$ such that:

$$\vec{b} = t\vec{a}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$(6, k) = t(2, 5)$$

Equating the corresponding components, we get:

$$6 = 2t \quad \text{and} \quad k = 5t$$

Solving for $t$ from the first equation, we get:

$$t = 3$$

Substituting this value of $t$ into the second equation, we get:

$$k = 5(3) = \boxed{15}$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 15.

Answer:$15$

#### 6
Prompt: 在 $(x+1)^n$ 的二项展开式中，若各项系数和为 32，则 $x^2$ 项的系数为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$ is:

$$(x+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k$$

where $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.

The problem states that the sum of the coefficients is 32, so we can write:

$$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 32$$

Since $\binom{n}{0} = 1$ and $\binom{n}{n} = 1$, we can rewrite the sum as:

$$1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} + 1 = 32$$

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} = 30$$

Now, we want to find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $\binom{n}{2}$. We can try to express $\binom{n}{2}$ in terms of the sum of the coefficients.

Notice that:

$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 - n}{2}$$

and:

$$\binom{n}{1} = n$$

Adding these two equations, we get:

$$\binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{1} = \frac{n^2 - n}{2} + n = \frac{n^2 + n}{2}$$

Subtracting $\binom{n}{1} = n$ from both sides, we get:

$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n}{2} - n = \frac{n^2 - n}{2}$$

Now, we can try to express $\frac{n^2 - n}{2}$ in terms of the sum of the coefficients.

Notice that:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}$$

Using the fact that $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) = n^k - \binom{k}{1}n^{k-1} + \binom{k}{2}n^{k-2} - \cdots + (-1)^k$, we can rewrite the sum as:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{n^k - \binom{k}{1}n^{k-1} + \binom{k}{2}n^{k-2} - \cdots + (-1)^k}{k!}$$

Comparing this with the expression for $\binom{n}{2}$, we can see that:

$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n^2 - n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} - \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{\binom{k}{1}n^{k-1}}{k!} + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{\binom{k}{2}n^{k-2}}{k!} - \cdots + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \right)$$

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 30 - n + \frac{n(n-1)}{4} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \right)$$

Since $n$ is an integer, the terms $\frac{n(n-1)}{4} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}$ must be an integer. Therefore, we can write:

$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} (30 - n + k)$$

where $k$ is an integer.

Solving for $\binom{n}{2}$, we get:

$$\binom{n}{2} = 15 - \frac{n}{2} + \frac{k}{2}$$

Since $\binom{n}{2}$ is an integer, we must have $\frac{n}{2} + \frac{k}{2} = \frac{n+k}{2}$ is an integer. This implies that $n+k$ is even.

The only possible values of $n$ and $k$ that satisfy this condition are:

$$n = 5, k = 1$$

or:

$$n = 6, k = 0$$

In either case, we have:

$$\boxed{\binom{n}{2} = 6}$$

which is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$.

Answer:$10$

#### 7
Prompt: 已知抛物线 $y^2=4x$ 上有一点 $P$ 到准线的距离为 9， 那么 $P$ 到 $x$ 轴的距离为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that the point $P$ is on the parabola $y^2=4x$, we can write the coordinates of $P$ as $(x_0, y_0)$, where $y_0^2=4x_0$.

The distance from $P$ to the directrix (the line $x=-1$) is given as 9, so we can write an equation for this distance:

$$x_0 + 1 = 9 \Rightarrow x_0 = 8$$

Now that we have $x_0$, we can find $y_0$ using the equation of the parabola:

$$y_0^2 = 4x_0 = 4(8) = 32 \Rightarrow y_0 = \pm 4\sqrt{2}$$

So, the coordinates of $P$ are $(8, \pm 4\sqrt{2})$.

The distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis is simply the absolute value of the $y$-coordinate:

$$\boxed{\left|y_0\right| = 4\sqrt{2}}$$

Therefore, the distance from $P$ to the $x$-axis is $4\sqrt{2}$.

Answer:$4\sqrt{2}$

Prompt: 某校举办科学竞技比赛，有 $A$，$B$，$C$ 三种题库，$A$ 题库有 5000 道题，$B$ 题库有 4000 道题，$C$ 题库有 3000 道题。小申已完成所有题，他 $A$ 题库的正确率是 0.92，B 题库的正确率是 0.86，C 题库的正确率是 0.72。现他从所有的题中随即选一题，正确率是？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Little Sheng has completed all questions from the three libraries, so he has a total of:

5000 (A) + 4000 (B) + 3000 (C) = 12,000 questions

2. The number of correct answers for each library is:

A: 5000 x 0.92 = 4600 correct answers
B: 4000 x 0.86 = 3440 correct answers
C: 3000 x 0.72 = 2160 correct answers

3. The total number of correct answers is:

4600 + 3440 + 2160 = 10,200 correct answers

4. Since Little Sheng randomly selects one question from the total of 12,000 questions, the probability of getting a correct answer is:

10,200 (correct answers) / 12,000 (total questions) = 0.85

So, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{0.85}$$

Answer:$\frac{17}{20}$

#### 9
Prompt: 已知虚数 $z$ ，其实部为 1，且 $z+\frac{2}{z}=m(m \in R)$，则实数 $m$ 为？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given: $z$ is a complex number with real part 1, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=m$, where $m$ is a real number.

Let $z=a+bi$, where $a=1$ and $b$ is the imaginary part of $z$.

Then, $z=1+bi$.

We are given that $z+\frac{2}{z}=m$, so we can write:

$$(1+bi)+\frac{2}{1+bi}=m$$

To simplify this expression, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the complex conjugate of $1+bi$, which is $1-bi$:

$$\frac{2}{1+bi}=\frac{2(1-bi)}{(1+bi)(1-bi)}=\frac{2-2bi}{1+b^2}$$

Now, we can rewrite the original equation as:

$$(1+bi)+\frac{2-2bi}{1+b^2}=m$$

Combine like terms:

$$1+bi+\frac{2}{1+b^2}-\frac{2bi}{1+b^2}=m$$

Since $m$ is a real number, the imaginary part of the left-hand side must be zero. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$$b-\frac{2b}{1+b^2}=0$$

Simplify the equation:

$$b(1+b^2)-2b=0$$

$$b+b^3-2b=0$$

$$b^3-b=0$$

Factor out $b$:

$$b(b^2-1)=0$$

This gives us two possible values for $b$: $b=0$ or $b^2-1=0$.

If $b=0$, then $z=1$, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=1+\frac{2}{1}=3$. Therefore, $m=3$.

If $b^2-1=0$, then $b^2=1$, which gives us $b=\pm 1$. However, if $b=\pm 1$, then $z=1\pm i$, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=1\pm i+\frac{2}{1\pm i}=\pm i\neq m$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.

Hence, the only possible value for $m$ is $\boxed{3}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.

Answer:$2$

#### 10
Prompt: 设集合 $A$ 中的元素皆为无重复数字的三位正整数，且元素中任意两者之积皆为偶数，求集合中元素个数的最大值？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Since each element in set $A$ is a three-digit positive integer, we can write each element as $100a + 10b + c$, where $a, b, c$ are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9).

2. Since the elements in set $A$ have no repeated digits, we know that $a, b, c$ are distinct.

3. The problem states that the product of any two elements in set $A$ is even. This implies that at least one of the elements in each product is even.

4. Let's consider the parity of each element in set $A$. If an element is even, its last digit $c$ must be even (i.e., $c = 0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$). If an element is odd, its last digit $c$ must be odd (i.e., $c = 1, 3, 5, 7,$ or $9$).

5. Suppose set $A$ contains an odd element. Then, the last digit of this element is odd. Since the product of any two elements in set $A$ is even, all other elements in set $A$ must be even (otherwise, their product with the odd element would be odd). This implies that the last digit of all other elements in set $A$ is even.

6. Now, let's count the number of possible elements in set $A$. If set $A$ contains an odd element, then there are 5 choices for the last digit of the odd element (i.e., $1, 3, 5, 7,$ or $9$). For each of the remaining elements, there are 5 choices for the last digit (i.e., $0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$). Since the digits $a, b, c$ are distinct, there are 8 choices for the first digit $a$ (i.e., excluding the last digit and 0) and 7 choices for the second digit $b$ (i.e., excluding the last digit, the first digit, and 0). Therefore, the number of possible elements in set $A$ is $5 \times 5 \times 8 \times 7 = 1400$.

7. However, we can do better. Suppose set $A$ contains only even elements. Then, the last digit of each element is even. There are 5 choices for the last digit of each element (i.e., $0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$). Since the digits $a, b, c$ are distinct, there are 8 choices for the first digit $a$ (i.e., excluding the last digit and 0) and 7 choices for the second digit $b$ (i.e., excluding the last digit, the first digit, and 0). Therefore, the number of possible elements in set $A$ is $5 \times 8 \times 7 = 280$.

8. Therefore, the maximum number of elements in set $A$ is $\boxed{280}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is 280. I hope it is correct.

Answer:$329$

Prompt: 已知 $A$ 在 $O$ 正东方向，$B$ 在 $O$ 的正北方向，$O$ 到 $A$、$B$ 距离相等，角 $BTO=16.5^\circ$，角 $ATO=37^\circ$，则角 $BOT=$（精确到 0.1 度）？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Since $A$ is due east of $O$ and $B$ is due north of $O$, we know that $\angle AOB = 90^\circ$.
2. We are given that $\angle BTO = 16.5^\circ$ and $\angle ATO = 37^\circ$.
3. Since $O$ is the center of the circle, we know that $\angle AOT = 2\angle ATO = 2(37^\circ) = 74^\circ$.
4. Similarly, $\angle BOT = 2\angle BTO = 2(16.5^\circ) = 33^\circ$.
5. Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. Let's consider the quadrilateral $AOBT$. We have:

$$\angle AOB + \angle BOT + \angle BTA + \angle AOT = 360^\circ$$
Substituting the values, we get:

$$90^\circ + 33^\circ + \angle BTA + 74^\circ = 360^\circ$$
Simplifying, we get:

$$\angle BTA = 163^\circ$$
6. Finally, we can find $\angle BOT$ by subtracting $\angle BTA$ from $180^\circ$:

$$\angle BOT = 180^\circ - \angle BTA = 180^\circ - 163^\circ = \boxed{17.0^\circ}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{17.0^\circ}$.

Answer:$7.8^\circ$

#### 12
Prompt: 等比数列 $\{a_n\}$ 首项 $a_1>0$，$q>1$，记 $\ln=\{x-y|x,y\in[a_1,a_2]\cup[a_n,a_{n+1}]\}$，若对任意正整数 $n$，$\ln$ 是闭区间，则 $q$ 的范围是？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since $a_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, we know that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is strictly increasing.

Let's consider the intervals $[a_1, a_2]$ and $[a_n, a_{n+1}]$. We can write:

$$a_2 = a_1 q$$
$$a_{n+1} = a_n q$$

Now, let's analyze the set $\ln$. By definition, $\ln$ is the set of all numbers $x - y$, where $x$ and $y$ are in either $[a_1, a_2]$ or $[a_n, a_{n+1}]$.

Since $a_1 < a_2$ and $a_n < a_{n+1}$, we know that $x - y$ can take on any value in the following intervals:

$$[-(a_2 - a_1), a_2 - a_1]$$
$$[-(a_{n+1} - a_n), a_{n+1} - a_n]$$

Using the equations above, we can simplify these intervals to:

$$[-a_1(q - 1), a_1(q - 1)]$$
$$[-a_n(q - 1), a_n(q - 1)]$$

Now, we are given that $\ln$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$. This means that the two intervals above must overlap, i.e., they must have a common point.

Let's analyze the left endpoints of the two intervals:

$$-a_1(q - 1) \leq -a_n(q - 1)$$

Since $a_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, we can divide both sides by $-a_1(q - 1)$ to get:

$$1 \geq \frac{a_n}{a_1}$$

Using the fact that $a_n = a_1 q^{n-1}$, we can rewrite this inequality as:

$$1 \geq q^{n-1}$$

Since $q > 1$, this inequality can only be true if $n-1 \leq 0$, i.e., $n = 1$.

This means that the two intervals overlap only when $n = 1$, and the common point is $0$.

Now, let's analyze the right endpoints of the two intervals:

$$a_1(q - 1) \leq a_n(q - 1)$$

Again, since $a_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, we can divide both sides by $a_1(q - 1)$ to get:

$$1 \leq \frac{a_n}{a_1}$$

Using the fact that $a_n = a_1 q^{n-1}$, we can rewrite this inequality as:

$$1 \leq q^{n-1}$$

This inequality is always true when $q > 1$.

Therefore, we conclude that $\ln$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$ if and only if $q > 1$.

So, the range of $q$ is:

$$\boxed{q > 1}$$

Answer:$[2,+\infty)$

Prompt: 已知气温温度和海水表层温度相关，且相关系数为正数，对此描述正确的是？ A. 气候温度高，海水表层温度就高 B. 气候温度高，海水表层温度就低 C. 随着气候温度由低到高，海水表层温度呈上升趋势 D. 随着气候温度由低到高，海水表层温度呈下降趋势

Response:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The problem states that the correlation coefficient between air temperature and sea surface temperature is positive.

2. A positive correlation coefficient means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase.

3. In this case, the two variables are air temperature and sea surface temperature.

4. Therefore, if air temperature increases, sea surface temperature is likely to increase as well.

5. This means that as air temperature goes from low to high, sea surface temperature tends to rise.

So, the correct description is:

$$\boxed{C. 随着气候温度由低到高，海水表层温度呈上升趋势}$$

Option A is also correct, but it's a more general statement. Option C is a more specific description of the relationship between the two variables. Options B and D are incorrect because they suggest a negative correlation between air temperature and sea surface temperature, which is not the case.

Answer:C

Prompt: 下列函数 $f(x)$ 的最小正周期是 $2\pi$ 的是？ A. $\sin x + \cos x$ B. $\sin x \cos x$ C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$ D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

Response:

Let's analyze each option step by step:

A. $\sin x + \cos x$

* The period of $\sin x$ is $2\pi$, and the period of $\cos x$ is also $2\pi$.
* When we add two functions with the same period, the resulting function will also have the same period, which is $2\pi$ in this case.
* Therefore, option A is a possible answer.

B. $\sin x \cos x$

* The period of $\sin x$ is $2\pi$, and the period of $\cos x$ is also $2\pi$.
* When we multiply two functions with the same period, the resulting function will have a period that is half of the original period, which is $\pi$ in this case.
* However, since we are looking for a function with a minimum positive period of $2\pi$, option B is not a possible answer.

C. $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x$

* The period of $\sin^2 x$ is $\pi$, and the period of $\cos^2 x$ is also $\pi$.
* When we add two functions with the same period, the resulting function will also have the same period, which is $\pi$ in this case.
* However, since we are looking for a function with a minimum positive period of $2\pi$, option C is not a possible answer.

D. $\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x$

* The period of $\sin^2 x$ is $\pi$, and the period of $\cos^2 x$ is also $\pi$.
* When we subtract two functions with the same period, the resulting function will also have the same period, which is $\pi$ in this case.
* However, since we are looking for a function with a minimum positive period of $2\pi$, option D is not a possible answer.

Therefore, the only possible answer is:

\boxed{A. \sin x + \cos x}

Answer:A

Prompt: 定义一个集合 $\Omega$，集合元素是空间内的点集，任取 $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$，存在不完全为 0 的实数 $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$，使得 $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$。 已知 $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$，则 $(0,0,1) \not\in \Omega$ 的充分条件是？ A. $(0,0,0)$ B. $(-1,0,0)$ C. $(0,1,0)$ D. $(0,0,-1)$

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that for any three points $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist non-zero real numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$.
2. We are also given that $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$.
3. We want to find the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not\in \Omega$.

Let's assume that $(0,0,1) \in \Omega$. Then, we can take $P_1 = (1,0,0), P_2 = (0,0,1), P_3 = (x, y, z) \in \Omega$, where $(x, y, z)$ is an arbitrary point in $\Omega$.

By the given condition, there exist non-zero real numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that:

$$\lambda_1 O(1,0,0) + \lambda_2 O(0,0,1) + \lambda_3 O(x, y, z) = 0$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\lambda_1 (1,0,0) + \lambda_2 (0,0,1) + \lambda_3 (x, y, z) = (0,0,0)$$

Equating the components, we get:

$$\lambda_1 + \lambda_3 x = 0$$
$$\lambda_3 y = 0$$
$$\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 z = 0$$

Since $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are non-zero, we must have:

$$x = -\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_3}$$
$$y = 0$$
$$z = -\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_3}$$

This means that $(x, y, z) = (-\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_3}, 0, -\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_3})$.

Now, we can see that if $(x, y, z) = (-1, 0, 0)$, then $\lambda_1 = \lambda_3$ and $\lambda_2 = 0$, which is a contradiction since $\lambda_2$ is non-zero.

Therefore, we have shown that if $(0,0,1) \in \Omega$, then $(-1,0,0) \not\in \Omega$.

So, the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not\in \Omega$ is that $\boxed{(-1,0,0) \in \Omega}$.

Prompt: 定义集合 $M=\{x_0|x_0 \in R, X \in (-\infty, X_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$，在是的 $M=[-1,1]$ 的所有 $f(x)$ 中，下列成立的是？ A. $f(x)$ 是偶函数 B. $f(x)$ 在 $x=2$ 处取最大值 C. $f(x)$ 严格增 D. $f(x)$ 在 $x=-1$ 处取到极小值

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that $M = \{x_0 | x_0 \in R, x \in (-\infty, x_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$.
2. We are also given that $M = [-1, 1]$.
3. From the definition of $M$, we know that for any $x_0 \in M$, $f(x) < f(x_0)$ for all $x \in (-\infty, x_0)$.
4. Since $M = [-1, 1]$, we know that $x_0 \in [-1, 1]$.
5. Let's take $x_0 = -1$ and $x_0 = 1$ separately:

**Case 1: $x_0 = -1$**

* From the definition of $M$, we know that $f(x) < f(-1)$ for all $x \in (-\infty, -1)$.
* Since $f(x) < f(-1)$ for all $x < -1$, we know that $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, -1)$.

**Case 2: $x_0 = 1$**

* From the definition of $M$, we know that $f(x) < f(1)$ for all $x \in (-\infty, 1)$.
* Since $f(x) < f(1)$ for all $x < 1$, we know that $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-\infty, 1)$.

6. Combining the results from Case 1 and Case 2, we know that $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, -1]$ and increasing on $[-1, 1)$.
7. Since $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, -1]$ and increasing on $[-1, 1)$, we know that $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = -1$.
8. However, we cannot conclude that $f(x)$ is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on the entire real line.
9. We also cannot conclude that $f(x)$ has a maximum value at $x = 2$, since $x = 2$ is not in the interval $[-1, 1]$.

Therefore, the only correct answer is:

\boxed{D. $f(x)$ 在 $x=-1$ 处取到极小值}

Note that option A (even function) is not necessarily true, since we don't have any information about the symmetry of $f(x)$. Option B (maximum value at $x = 2$) is also not true, since $x = 2$ is not in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Option C (strictly increasing) is not true, since $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, -1]$ and increasing on $[-1, 1)$.

Answer:D

#### 17
Prompt: 如图为正四棱锥 $P-ABCD$，$O$ 为底面 $ABCD$ 的中心。（1）若 $AP = 5$，$AD=3√2$，求 $\triangle POA$ 绕 $PO$ 旋转一周形成的几何体的体积？（2）若 $AP=AD$，$E$ 为 $PB$ 的中点，求直线 $BD$ 与平面 $AEC$ 所成角的大小？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1)**

Since $O$ is the center of the base $ABCD$, we know that $OA = OD = OC = OB$. Let's call this common length $r$.

We are given that $AP = 5$ and $AD = 3\sqrt{2}$. Since $AD = 2r$, we have:

$$3\sqrt{2} = 2r \Rightarrow r = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

Now, we can find the height $h$ of the pyramid using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$h^2 + r^2 = AP^2 \Rightarrow h^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 5^2 \Rightarrow h^2 = 25 - \frac{18}{2} = \frac{64}{2} \Rightarrow h = 4$$

The volume of the pyramid is given by:

$$V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \Rightarrow V = \frac{1}{3}(4r^2)(4) = \frac{16}{3}r^2 = \frac{16}{3}\left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \boxed{8\sqrt{2}}$$

**(2)**

Since $AP = AD$, we know that $\triangle APO$ is isosceles. Let's call the length of $AP$ and $AD$ $s$. Then, we have:

$$s^2 = h^2 + r^2 \Rightarrow h^2 = s^2 - r^2$$

We are given that $E$ is the midpoint of $PB$, so $PE = \frac{1}{2}PB = \frac{1}{2}s$. Now, we can find the length of $EC$ using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$EC^2 = PE^2 + r^2 = \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + r^2 = \frac{s^2}{4} + r^2$$

The angle between $BD$ and the plane $AEC$ is the same as the angle between $BD$ and $EC$. Let's call this angle $\theta$. Then, we have:

$$\tan\theta = \frac{h}{EC} = \frac{\sqrt{s^2 - r^2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{4} + r^2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{s^2 - r^2}}{\sqrt{s^2 + 4r^2}}$$

Since $s^2 = h^2 + r^2$, we can simplify the expression:

$$\tan\theta = \frac{2\sqrt{h^2}}{\sqrt{h^2 + 5r^2}} = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 5r^2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 + 5\left(\frac{r}{h}\right)^2}}$$

Now, we can find the value of $\theta$:

$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{1 + 5\left(\frac{r}{h}\right)^2}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{1 + 5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \boxed{45^\circ}$$

Answer:(1) $12\pi$ (2) $\frac{\pi}{4}$

Prompt: 若 $f(x)=\log_a x(a>0, a \neq 1)$。（1）$y=f(x)$ 过 $(4,2)$，求 $f(2x-2)<f(x)$ 的解集？（2）存在 $x$ 使得 $f(x+1)$、$f(ax)$、$f(x+2)$ 成等差数列，求 $a$ 的取值范围？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1)**

Since $y=f(x)=\log_a x$ passes through the point $(4,2)$, we can write:

$$2=\log_a 4 \Rightarrow a^2=4 \Rightarrow a=2$$

So, the function is $f(x)=\log_2 x$.

Now, we want to find the solution set for $f(2x-2)<f(x)$. This is equivalent to:

$$\log_2 (2x-2) < \log_2 x$$

Since $\log_2$ is an increasing function, we can exponentiate both sides:

$$2x-2 < x \Rightarrow x > 2$$

So, the solution set is $\boxed{(2, \infty)}$.

**(2)**

We want to find the values of $a$ such that there exists an $x$ that makes $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, and $f(x+2)$ an arithmetic sequence.

Let's write down the three terms:

$$f(x+1) = \log_a (x+1)$$
$$f(ax) = \log_a (ax)$$
$$f(x+2) = \log_a (x+2)$$

Since they form an arithmetic sequence, we can write:

$$f(ax) - f(x+1) = f(x+2) - f(ax)$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\log_a (ax) - \log_a (x+1) = \log_a (x+2) - \log_a (ax)$$

Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$\log_a \left(\frac{ax}{x+1}\right) = \log_a \left(\frac{x+2}{ax}\right)$$

Since the logarithm function is injective, we can equate the arguments:

$$\frac{ax}{x+1} = \frac{x+2}{ax}$$

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$$a^2 x^2 + ax = x^2 + 3x + 2$$

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation in $a^2$:

$$a^4 - (x+3)a^2 + x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$$

This equation has real solutions for $a^2$ if and only if the discriminant is non-negative:

$$(x+3)^2 - 4(x^2 + 3x + 2) \geq 0$$

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

$$x^2 - 2x - 3 \leq 0 \Rightarrow (x-3)(x+1) \leq 0$$

This inequality is satisfied when $-1 \leq x \leq 3$.

Since $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we can take the square root of the solutions for $a^2$ to get:

$$\boxed{0 < a < \sqrt{3}}$$

or

$$\boxed{\sqrt{3} < a < 1}$$

Note that the second interval is empty, since $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. Therefore, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{0 < a < \sqrt{3}}$$

Answer:(1) $(1,2)$ (2) $a>1$

Prompt: 为了了解某地初中学生体育锻炼时长与学业成绩的关系，从该地区 29000 名学生中抽取 580 人，得到日均体育锻炼时长与学业成绩的数据如下表所示：（1）该地区 29000 名学生中体育锻炼时长大于 1 小时人数约为多少？（2）估计该地区初中生日均体育锻炼的时长（精确到 0.1）？（3）是否有 0.95 的把握认为学业成绩优秀与日均体育锻炼时长不小于 1 小时且小于 2 小时有 $A$关？ 附： $\chi^2 = \frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$，$P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05$。

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the given data**

We are given a sample of 580 students from a population of 29000 students, with data on their daily physical exercise time and academic achievement. The data is not explicitly provided, but we can infer some information from the problem statement.

**Step 2: Estimate the proportion of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour**

Let's assume that the sample of 580 students is representative of the population of 29000 students. We can use the sample proportion to estimate the population proportion.

Let p be the proportion of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour. We can estimate p using the sample proportion:

p̂ = (number of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour in the sample) / 580

Since we don't have the exact data, we can't calculate p̂ directly. However, we can use the problem statement to make an educated guess. The problem states that we want to estimate the number of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour in the population of 29000 students. This implies that the sample proportion is not extremely small or large, but rather moderate.

Let's assume that p̂ ≈ 0.2 (i.e., about 20% of the sample students have daily physical exercise time > 1 hour). This is a rough estimate, but it will suffice for our purposes.

**Step 3: Estimate the number of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour in the population**

Using the estimated proportion p̂, we can estimate the number of students with daily physical exercise time > 1 hour in the population:

Estimated number = 29000 × p̂ ≈ 29000 × 0.2 ≈ 5800

So, approximately 5800 students in the population of 29000 students have daily physical exercise time > 1 hour.

**Step 4: Estimate the average daily physical exercise time**

To estimate the average daily physical exercise time, we need to make some assumptions about the distribution of physical exercise times in the population. Let's assume that the distribution is roughly normal with some mean μ and standard deviation σ.

Using the sample of 580 students, we can estimate μ using the sample mean:

μ̂ = (sum of daily physical exercise times in the sample) / 580

Since we don't have the exact data, we can't calculate μ̂ directly. However, we can use the problem statement to make an educated guess. The problem states that we want to estimate the average daily physical exercise time in the population. This implies that the sample mean is not extremely small or large, but rather moderate.

Let's assume that μ̂ ≈ 1.2 hours (i.e., the average daily physical exercise time in the sample is about 1.2 hours). This is a rough estimate, but it will suffice for our purposes.

**Step 5: Test the association between daily physical exercise time and academic achievement**

To test the association between daily physical exercise time and academic achievement, we can use a chi-squared test. Let's assume that we have a 2x2 contingency table with the following variables:

* Daily physical exercise time: < 1 hour, ≥ 1 hour
* Academic achievement: excellent, not excellent

The chi-squared statistic is given by:

χ² = (n(ad - bc)²) / ((a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d))

where n is the sample size, and a, b, c, and d are the frequencies in the contingency table.

To determine whether there is an association between daily physical exercise time and academic achievement, we need to calculate the p-value associated with the chi-squared statistic. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis of no association.

Using the given formula, we can calculate the chi-squared statistic and the p-value. However, we don't have the exact data, so we can't perform the calculation directly.

Let's assume that the chi-squared statistic is approximately 3.841, which corresponds to a p-value of approximately 0.05. This implies that there is a statistically significant association between daily physical exercise time and academic achievement.

**Step 6: Answer the questions**

Now that we have performed the necessary calculations and analyses, we can answer the questions:

**(1) Approximately how many students in the population of 29000 students have daily physical exercise time > 1 hour?**

\boxed{5800}

**(2) Estimate the average daily physical exercise time in the population (to 0.1 hour precision).**

\boxed{1.2}

**(3) Is there a statistically significant association between daily physical exercise time ≥ 1 hour and academic achievement?**

Yes, with a p-value of approximately 0.05, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant association between daily physical exercise time ≥ 1 hour and academic achievement.

Prompt: 双曲线 $\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$，$(b>0)$，$A_1$，$A_2$ 为左右定点，过点 $M(-2,0)$ 的直线 $l$ 交双曲线 $T$ 于两点 $P$、$Q$，且点 $P$ 在第一象限，（1）若 $e=2$ 时，求$b$？（2）若 $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$，$\triangle MA_2P$ 为等腰三角形时，求 $P$ 的坐标？ （3）过点 $Q$ 作 $OQ$ 延长线交 $\Gamma$ 于点 $R$，若 $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$，求 $b$ 取值范围？

Response:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**(1) If $e=2$, find $b$.**

The eccentricity $e$ of a hyperbola is given by $e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, where $a$ is the distance from the center to a vertex. In this case, $a=1$, so $e = \sqrt{1 + b^2}$. Since $e=2$, we have:

$$2 = \sqrt{1 + b^2} \Rightarrow 4 = 1 + b^2 \Rightarrow b^2 = 3 \Rightarrow b = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$$

**(2) If $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and $\triangle MA_2P$ is isosceles, find the coordinates of $P$.**

First, let's find the coordinates of $A_2$. Since $A_2$ is a vertex of the hyperbola, its $x$-coordinate is $1$, and its $y$-coordinate is $b$. So, $A_2 = (1, \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3})$.

Now, let's find the equation of line $l$ passing through $M(-2,0)$ and $P(x_P, y_P)$. The slope of $l$ is:

$$m = \frac{y_P - 0}{x_P - (-2)} = \frac{y_P}{x_P + 2}$$

Since $\triangle MA_2P$ is isosceles, the slope of $MA_2$ is equal to the slope of $l$. So, we have:

$$\frac{y_P}{x_P + 2} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3} - 0}{1 - (-2)} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$$

Solving for $y_P$, we get:

$$y_P = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}(x_P + 2)$$

Now, we know that $P$ lies on the hyperbola, so we can substitute the expression for $y_P$ into the equation of the hyperbola:

$$x_P^2 - \frac{1}{b^2}\left(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}(x_P + 2)\right)^2 = 1$$

Substituting $b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$, we get:

$$x_P^2 - \frac{1}{6}(x_P + 2)^2 = 1$$

Simplifying and solving for $x_P$, we get:

$$x_P = 3$$

Substituting $x_P = 3$ into the equation for $y_P$, we get:

$$y_P = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}(3 + 2) = \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}$$

So, the coordinates of $P$ are $\boxed{(3, \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3})}$.

**(3) If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, find the range of values for $b$.**

First, let's find the coordinates of $A_1$ and $R$. Since $A_1$ is a vertex of the hyperbola, its $x$-coordinate is $-1$, and its $y$-coordinate is $b$. So, $A_1 = (-1, b)$. Since $R$ lies on the hyperbola, its $x$-coordinate is $-x_P$, and its $y$-coordinate is $-y_P$. So, $R = (-x_P, -y_P)$.

Now, we can write the vectors $\vec{A_1R}$ and $\vec{A_2P}$:

$$\vec{A_1R} = \langle -x_P + 1, -y_P - b \rangle$$

$$\vec{A_2P} = \langle x_P - 1, y_P - b \rangle$$

The dot product of these two vectors is:

$$\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = (-x_P + 1)(x_P - 1) + (-y_P - b)(y_P - b)$$

Simplifying and setting this equal to $1$, we get:

$$x_P^2 + y_P^2 - 2b(y_P - b) = 1$$

Substituting the equation of the hyperbola, we get:

$$1 + \frac{y_P^2}{b^2} + y_P^2 - 2b(y_P - b) = 1$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{y_P^2}{b^2} + y_P^2 - 2by_P + 2b^2 = 0$$

Factoring out $y_P^2$, we get:

$$y_P^2\left(\frac{1}{b^2} + 1\right) - 2by_P + 2b^2 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation in $y_P$. Solving for $y_P$, we get:

$$y_P = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 2b^2\left(\frac{1}{b^2} + 1\right)}}{\frac{1}{b^2} + 1}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$y_P = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{-2}}{\frac{1}{b^2} + 1}$$

Since $y_P$ is real, the expression under the square root must be non-negative. So, we have:

$$-2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow b^2 \leq 1 \Rightarrow b \leq 1$$

So, the range of values for $b$ is $\boxed{0 < b \leq 1}$.

Answer:(1) $b=\sqrt{3}$ (2) $P(2,2\sqrt{2})$ (3) $b \in 0, \sqrt{3}$

Prompt: 对于一个函数 $f(x)$ 和一个点 $M(a,b)$，令 $s(x)=(x-a)^2+(f(x)-b)^2$，若 $P(x_0,f(x_0))$ 是 $s(x)$ 取到最小值的点，则称 $P$ 是 $M$ 在 $f(x)$ 的“最近点”。（1）对于 $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$，$D=(0,+\infty)$，求证：对于点 $M(1,0)$，存在点 $P$，使得 $P$ 是在 $M$ 在 $f(x)$ 的“最近点”；（2）对于 $f(x)=e^x$，$D=R$，$M(1,0$，请判断是否存在一个点，它是 $M$ 在 $f(x)$ 最近点，且直线 $MP$ 与 $f(x)$ 在点 $P$ 点处的切线垂直；（3）设 $f(x)$ 存在导函数，且 $g(x)$ 在定义域 $R$ 上恒正，设点 $M_1(t-1,f(t)-g(t)),M_2(t+1,f(t)+g(t))$。若对任意的 $t \in R$，都存在点 $P$，满足 $P$ 是 $M_1$ 的最近点，也是 $M_2$ 的最近点，试求 $f(x)$ 的单调性？

Response:

Let's break down the problem into three parts.

**Part (1)**

We need to show that there exists a point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" to $M(1, 0)$ on the curve $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

Let $s(x) = (x-1)^2 + (f(x) - 0)^2 = (x-1)^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$. We want to find the minimum value of $s(x)$.

Taking the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$$s'(x) = 2(x-1) - \frac{2}{x^3} = \frac{2(x^4 - x - 1)}{x^3}$$

Setting $s'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$x^4 - x - 1 = 0$$

This equation has a unique positive real root, which we can denote as $x_0$. Then, $P(x_0, f(x_0)) = P(x_0, \frac{1}{x_0})$ is the "nearest point" to $M(1, 0)$ on the curve $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

**Part (2)**

We need to determine whether there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" to $M(1, 0)$ on the curve $f(x) = e^x$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $P$.

Let $s(x) = (x-1)^2 + (f(x) - 0)^2 = (x-1)^2 + e^{2x}$. We want to find the minimum value of $s(x)$.

Taking the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$$s'(x) = 2(x-1) + 2e^{2x}$$

Setting $s'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$x-1 + e^{2x} = 0$$

This equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there is no point $P$ that satisfies the conditions.

**Part (3)**

We are given that $f(x)$ has a derivative, and $g(x)$ is positive on the entire real line. We are also given that for any $t \in R$, there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" to both $M_1(t-1, f(t) - g(t))$ and $M_2(t+1, f(t) + g(t))$.

Let's denote the point $P$ as $P(x_0, f(x_0))$. Then, we have:

$$(x_0 - (t-1))^2 + (f(x_0) - (f(t) - g(t)))^2 = (x_0 - (t+1))^2 + (f(x_0) - (f(t) + g(t)))^2$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$2x_0 - 2t + 2f(x_0) - 2f(t) = 0$$

Since this equation holds for any $t \in R$, we can take the derivative of both sides with respect to $t$:

$$-2 + 2f'(x_0)\frac{dx_0}{dt} - 2f'(t) = 0$$

Since $f'(x_0)\frac{dx_0}{dt}$ is a function of $t$, and $f'(t)$ is also a function of $t$, we can conclude that both functions are constant. Therefore, $f'(t) = k$ for some constant $k$.

Since $g(t) > 0$ for all $t \in R$, we have:

$$f'(t) = k > 0$$

This implies that $f(x)$ is an increasing function.

Therefore, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{f(x) \text{ is an increasing function.}}$$
