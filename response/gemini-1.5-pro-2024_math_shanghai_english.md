Prompt: Given the universal set $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and set $A=\{2,4\}$, find $\bar{A}$?

Response:

Here's how to find the complement of set A:

**1. Understand the Complement:**

* The complement of a set A (denoted as  $\bar{A}$) is the set of all elements in the universal set (U) that are *not* in set A.

**2. Identify Elements in the Universal Set Not in A:**

*  Universal set (U): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
*  Set A: {2, 4}

* Elements in U but not in A: {1, 3, 5}

**3. Write the Complement Set:**

* Therefore, the complement of set A is:  $\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}$

**Final Answer:** $\boxed{\{1, 3, 5\}}$ 


Answer:$\{1,3,5\}$

Prompt: Given $f(x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{x}, x > 0 \\1, x \leq 0\end{cases}$, what is $f(3)$?

Response:

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Identify the relevant domain:**

* We need to find  *f(3)*. 
* Since 3 is greater than 0, we look at the part of the function definition where *x > 0*.

**2. Apply the correct function rule:**

* For *x > 0*, the function is defined as *f(x) = √x*.

**3. Substitute and calculate:**

* Substitute *x = 3* into the function: *f(3) = √3*.

**Answer:** 
Therefore,  $f(3) = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$. 


Answer:$\sqrt{3}$

Prompt: Given $x \in R$, what is the solution set for $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$?

Response:

Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:

**1. Factor the quadratic expression:**

The quadratic factors nicely:
  
  $x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1)$

**2. Find the critical points:**

The critical points are the values of *x* where the expression equals zero:

  *  x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3
  *  x + 1 = 0  =>  x = -1

**3. Create a sign chart:**

The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:

*  x < -1
*  -1 < x < 3
*  x > 3

Let's test a value within each interval to see if the expression (x - 3)(x + 1) is positive or negative:

| Interval     | Test Value | (x - 3) | (x + 1) | (x - 3)(x + 1) |
|--------------|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| x < -1       | x = -2     |  -      |  -      |      +          |
| -1 < x < 3  | x = 0      |  -      |  +      |      -          |
| x > 3       | x = 4      |  +      |  +      |      +          |

**4. Determine the solution:**

We want the values of *x* where (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0.  This occurs in the interval **-1 < x < 3**.

**Answer:** $\boxed{-1 < x < 3}$ 


Answer:$(-1,3)$

#### 4
Prompt: Given $F(x) = x^3 + a$, and $F(x)$ is an odd function, $x \in R$, what is $a$?

Response:

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Odd Functions**

An odd function has the property that  *f(-x) = -f(x)* for all *x* in its domain. 

**Applying the Definition**

1. **Find F(-x):** 
   Substitute *(-x)* for *x* in the expression for *F(x)*:
   *F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a = -x^3 + a*

2. **Find -F(x):**
   Multiply the expression for *F(x)* by -1:
   *-F(x) = -(x^3 + a) = -x^3 - a*

3. **Set F(-x) equal to -F(x):**
   Since *F(x)* is odd, these two expressions must be equal:
   *-x^3 + a = -x^3 - a*

4. **Solve for 'a':**
   *2a = 0*
   *a = 0*

**Answer**

Therefore, the value of *a* is $\boxed{0}$. 


Answer:$0$

#### 5
Prompt: Given $k \in R$, $\vec{a}=(2,5)$, $\vec{b}=(6,k)$, and $\vec{a}//\vec{b}$, what is the value of $k$?

Response:

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Parallel Vectors**

Two vectors are parallel if they are scalar multiples of each other.  This means there exists a non-zero scalar 't' such that:

  $\vec{a} = t\vec{b}$

**Setting up the Equation**

Given $\vec{a} = (2, 5)$ and $\vec{b} = (6, k)$, and knowing they are parallel, we can write:

 (2, 5) = t(6, k)

**Solving for 't' and 'k'**

This vector equation gives us two scalar equations:

1.  2 = 6t 
2.  5 = kt

From the first equation, we can solve for 't':

  t = 2/6 = 1/3

Substitute the value of 't' into the second equation:

  5 = (1/3)k

Solve for 'k':

  k = 5 * 3 = 15

**Answer**

Therefore, the value of k is $\boxed{15}$. 


Answer:$15$

#### 6
Prompt: In the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$, if the sum of all coefficients is 32, what is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term?

Response:

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. The Sum of Coefficients**

* The sum of the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form $(a+b)^n$ is found by setting  $a = b = 1$. 
* In our case, this means the sum of the coefficients of $(x+1)^n$ is $(1+1)^n = 2^n$.

**2. Finding 'n'**

* We're given that the sum of the coefficients is 32:  $2^n = 32$
* Solving for *n*, we find  $n = 5$.

**3. Binomial Theorem**

* The binomial theorem tells us that the term containing $x^k$ in the expansion of $(x+1)^n$ is given by: 
   
   $$\binom{n}{k}x^k(1)^{n-k} = \binom{n}{k}x^k$$

   where $\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:

   $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

**4. Finding the Coefficient of the x² Term**

* We want the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of $(x+1)^5$.  
* Using the binomial theorem (with $n=5$ and $k=2$), this coefficient is:

   $$\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5\times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$$

**Therefore, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\boxed{10}$.** 


Answer:$10$

#### 7
Prompt: Given a point $P$ on the parabola $y^2=4x$, and the distance from $P$ to the directrix is 9, what is the distance from $P$ to the x-axis?

Response:

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Understand the Properties of a Parabola**

* **Focus and Directrix:** A parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix).
* **Standard Form:** The given equation,  $y^2 = 4x$, represents a parabola that opens to the right.  The standard form of such a parabola is $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, where:
    * $(h,k)$ is the vertex 
    * $p$ is the distance between the vertex and the focus (and also the distance between the vertex and the directrix).

**2. Find the Vertex and 'p'**

* Comparing our equation, $y^2 = 4x$, to the standard form, we see that the vertex is at $(h,k) = (0,0)$.
* We also see that $4p = 4$, so $p=1$.

**3. Visualize the Situation**

* Since the parabola opens right and the vertex is at the origin, the directrix is a vertical line to the left of the vertex. 
* Because $p=1$, the directrix is the line $x=-1$.

**4. Use the Distance Information**

* We're given that the distance from point $P$ to the directrix ($x=-1$) is 9.  
* Since the directrix is a vertical line, any point $P$ that is 9 units away from it will have an $x$-coordinate of either $-1 - 9 = -10$ or $-1 + 9 = 8$.
* However, since the parabola opens to the right, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ must be greater than the vertex's $x$-coordinate (which is 0). Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is 8.

**5. Find the y-coordinate of P**

* Substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola: $y^2 = 4(8) = 32$
* Solving for $y$, we get $y = \pm \sqrt{32} = \pm 4\sqrt{2}$. 

**6. Determine the Distance to the x-axis**

* The distance from a point to the x-axis is simply the absolute value of its $y$-coordinate. 
* Therefore, the distance from $P$ to the x-axis is $\boxed{4\sqrt{2}}$. 


Answer:$4\sqrt{2}$

Prompt: A school is holding a science competition with three question banks: A, B, and C. Question bank A has 5000 questions, B has 4000 questions, and C has 3000 questions. Xiao Shen has completed all the questions. His accuracy rate for question bank A is 0.92, for B is 0.86, and for C is 0.72. Now, if he randomly selects a question from all the questions, what is the probability of answering it correctly?

Response:

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of questions answered correctly from each bank:**

* Bank A: 5000 questions * 0.92 accuracy = 4600 questions correct
* Bank B: 4000 questions * 0.86 accuracy = 3440 questions correct
* Bank C: 3000 questions * 0.72 accuracy = 2160 questions correct

**2. Calculate the total number of questions answered correctly:**

* Total correct: 4600 + 3440 + 2160 = 10200 questions

**3. Calculate the total number of questions:**

* Total questions: 5000 + 4000 + 3000 = 12000 questions

**4. Calculate the overall probability of answering a question correctly:**

* Probability = (Total questions answered correctly) / (Total number of questions)
* Probability = 10200 / 12000 
* Probability = 0.85

Therefore, the probability of Xiao Shen answering a randomly selected question correctly is $\boxed{0.85}$.

#### 9
Prompt: Given a complex number $z$ with real part 1, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=m(m \in R)$, what is the real number $m$?

Response:

Let $z = 1 + yi$, where $y$ is a real number.  Then
\[\frac{2}{z} = \frac{2}{1 + yi} \cdot \frac{1 - yi}{1 - yi} = \frac{2 - 2yi}{1 + y^2} = \frac{2}{1 + y^2} - \frac{2y}{1 + y^2} i.\]Hence,
\[z + \frac{2}{z} = \left( 1 + \frac{2}{1 + y^2} \right) + \left( y - \frac{2y}{1 + y^2} \right) i.\]Since $z + \frac{2}{z}$ is a real number,
\[y - \frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = 0.\]This factors as $y \left( 1 - \frac{2}{1 + y^2} \right) = 0.$  Hence, $y = 0$ or $1 + y^2 = 2.$  The second equation implies $y = \pm 1.$

If $y = 0,$ then $z = 1,$ so $z + \frac{2}{z} = 3.$

If $y = 1,$ then $z = 1 + i,$ so $z + \frac{2}{z} = 2.$

If $y = -1,$ then $z = 1 - i,$ so $z + \frac{2}{z} = 2.$

Thus, the possible values of $m$ are $\boxed{2,3}.$

Answer:$2$

#### 10
Prompt: Let the elements in set $A$ be three-digit positive integers without repeated digits, and the product of any two elements in the set is always even. What is the maximum number of elements that can be in this set?

Response:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the largest possible set of three-digit numbers with no repeating digits, where multiplying any two numbers from the set always results in an even number.

**Key Observation**

The product of two integers is even unless both integers are odd.  This means to ensure an even product, we need to make sure at least one of the numbers is always even.

**Building the Set**

* **Maximize Even Numbers:** To maximize the size of our set, we should include as many even numbers as possible. 
* **Even Digits:** We have the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 to work with for our even numbers.
* **Hundreds Digit:**  The hundreds digit cannot be 0.  So, we have 4 choices for the hundreds digit (2, 4, 6, 8).
* **Tens Digit:** We have 4 remaining choices for the tens digit (0 and the 3 even digits we didn't use for the hundreds place).
* **Units Digit:** We have 3 remaining choices for the units digit.

This gives us a total of 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 possible even numbers.

**Can We Add Odd Numbers?**

No. If we add even a single odd number to our set, we can multiply it with another odd number from the set, resulting in an odd product.

**Conclusion**

The maximum number of elements in set A is the number of even three-digit numbers we can form without repeating digits, which is $\boxed{48}$.

#### 11
Prompt: Given that $A$ is due east of $O$, $B$ is due north of $O$, the distances from $O$ to $A$ and $B$ are equal, angle $BTO=16.5^\circ$, angle $ATO=37^\circ$, what is angle $BOT=$ (to the nearest 0.1 degree)?

Response:

Let's break down this geometry problem step-by-step:

**1. Visualize the Problem**

Draw a diagram. Since distances OA and OB are equal, triangle OAB is isosceles.

[asy]
pair A,B,O,T;
O=(0,0);
A=(2,0);
B=(0,2);
T=(0.8,0.4);
draw(A--B--O--cycle);
draw(O--T);
label("$A$",A,SE);
label("$B$",B,N);
label("$O$",O,SW);
label("$T$",T,SE);
label("$16.5^\circ$",(0.6,0.1));
label("$37^\circ$",(0.3,0.2));
[/asy]

**2. Use Triangle Properties**

* **Isosceles Triangle:** Since OA = OB, we know that angle OAB = angle OBA.
* **Angle Sum Property:** The angles inside triangle OAB add up to 180 degrees.

**3. Set Up Equations**

Let  x = angle OAB = angle OBA.  Then:

*  x + x + angle AOB = 180° 
*  2x + angle AOB = 180°

**4. Focus on Triangle BOT**

We want to find angle BOT. Notice that:

* angle BOT = angle AOB - angle AOT

We know angle AOT = 37°.  We need to find angle AOB.

**5. Solve for Angle AOB**

* From our earlier equation, angle AOB = 180° - 2x
* We need to find 'x'.  Look at triangle ATO. We have:
    * angle ATO = 37°
    * angle TAO = 90° (since A is due east of O)
    * Therefore, x = angle AOT = 180° - 90° - 37° = 53°

* Now we can find angle AOB:  angle AOB = 180° - 2(53°) = 74°

**6. Calculate Angle BOT**

* angle BOT = angle AOB - angle AOT = 74° - 37° = 37°

**7. Account for Angle BTO**

* Finally, within triangle BOT, we have:
    * angle BOT = 37°
    * angle BTO = 16.5°
    * Therefore, angle BOT = 180° - 37° - 16.5° = 126.5°

**Answer:**  Angle BOT = $\boxed{126.5^\circ}$ 


Answer:$7.8^\circ$

#### 12
Prompt: For a geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ with first term $a_1>0$ and common ratio $q>1$, let $I_n=\{x-y|x,y\in[a_1,a_2]\cup[a_n,a_{n+1}]\}$. If $I_n$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$, what is the range of $q$?

Response:

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a geometric sequence with positive terms that are increasing since the common ratio  $q > 1$.  The set $I_n$ is formed by taking all possible differences of elements from two specific intervals in the sequence: the interval containing the first two terms, and the interval containing the $n$th and $(n+1)$th terms.

The problem asks us to find the values of $q$ that guarantee $I_n$ will always be a closed interval, no matter how far out in the sequence we go.

**Step 1: Visualizing the Intervals**

Imagine the number line. The intervals $[a_1, a_2]$ and $[a_n, a_{n+1}]$ will be segments on this line, with the latter segment being further to the right since the sequence is increasing.  

**Step 2: Understanding Differences as Distances**

The expression  $|x - y|$ represents the distance between points $x$ and $y$ on the number line.  So, the set $I_n$ is the set of all possible distances we can get by picking one point from each of the intervals $[a_1, a_2]$ and $[a_n, a_{n+1}]$.

**Step 3: Finding the Minimum and Maximum of  $I_n$**

* **Minimum:** The smallest possible distance occurs when we pick the rightmost point of the left interval ($a_2$) and the leftmost point of the right interval ($a_n$). This minimum distance is $a_n - a_2$.

* **Maximum:** The largest possible distance occurs when we pick the leftmost point of the left interval ($a_1$) and the rightmost point of the right interval ($a_{n+1}$). This maximum distance is $a_{n+1} - a_1$.

**Step 4:  $I_n$ as a Closed Interval**

For $I_n$ to be a closed interval, it must contain all the distances between its minimum and maximum. In other words, we need to ensure that every number between $a_n - a_2$ and $a_{n+1} - a_1$ can be achieved as a difference of two numbers from our intervals.

**Step 5: The Crucial Condition**

The problem arises if the right interval $[a_n, a_{n+1}]$ is "too far" to the right. If the gap between the intervals is too large, we won't be able to get all the distances just by picking points from the ends.  

Specifically, the condition for $I_n$ to be a closed interval is that the length of the left interval must be greater than or equal to the gap between the intervals:

 $$a_2 - a_1 \ge (a_n - a_2) - (a_2 - a_1)$$

**Step 6: Simplifying the Inequality**

Simplifying the inequality from Step 5, we get:

$$2a_2 \ge a_n + a_1$$

**Step 7: Using the Geometric Sequence**

Recall that the terms are in a geometric sequence: $a_2 = a_1q$ and $a_n = a_1q^{n-1}$. Substituting these into our inequality:

$$2a_1q \ge a_1q^{n-1} + a_1$$

**Step 8: Solving for  $q$**

Since $a_1 > 0$, we can divide both sides by $a_1$ and rearrange:

$$q^{n-1} - 2q + 1 \le 0$$

Notice that $q = 1$ is a solution to this inequality.  However, we are given that $q > 1$.  Let's analyze the function $f(q) = q^{n-1} - 2q + 1$ for $q > 1$.  Its derivative is $f'(q) = (n-1)q^{n-2} - 2$, which is positive for $q > \left(\frac{2}{n-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-2}}$.  Since $f(1) = 0$ and $f(q)$ is increasing for sufficiently large $q$, the inequality $f(q) \le 0$ holds for $1 < q \le q_n$, where $q_n$ is the solution to $f(q) = 0$ that is greater than 1.

As $n$ increases, the value of $\left(\frac{2}{n-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-2}}$ approaches 1.  Therefore, the interval $(1,q_n]$ shrinks as $n$ increases.  In order for the inequality to hold for all positive integers $n$, we must have $q$ in the intersection of all these intervals.  The only value of $q$ that works for all $n$ is $q$ slightly larger than 1.

**Final Answer**

The range of $q$ is $\boxed{(1, q_2]}$, where $q_2$ is the solution to $q^1 - 2q + 1 = 0$ that is greater than 1.  Solving the quadratic, we find $q_2 = 1$.  Therefore, the range of $q$ is $\boxed{(1,1]}$, which is actually the empty set.  This means there is no value of $q > 1$ that works for all positive integers $n$. 


Answer:$[2,+\infty)$

#### 13
Prompt: Given that air temperature and sea surface temperature are correlated, and the correlation coefficient is positive, which of the following descriptions is correct?
A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high
B. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low
C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend
D. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend

Response:

Here's the breakdown:

* **Correlation:** A positive correlation coefficient means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. 
* **Air Temperature and Sea Surface Temperature:**  It's logical that warmer air would lead to warmer surface water temperatures.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high:** This aligns with the concept of positive correlation.
* **B. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low:** This contradicts the concept of positive correlation.
* **C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend:** This also aligns with positive correlation, indicating a general increase.
* **D. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend:** This contradicts positive correlation.

**Therefore, the correct descriptions are A and C.**

However, since the question asks for the *correct* description, and both A and C are correct but describe the relationship slightly differently, we need to choose the most accurate one. 

* **A** describes a snapshot in time (when one is high, the other is high).
* **C** describes the overall trend (as one increases, the other shows an upward trend).

**C** is slightly more accurate because correlation speaks to the overall trend rather than specific instances.

$\boxed{\text{C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend}}$ 


Answer:C

#### 14
Prompt: Which of the following functions $f(x)$ has a minimum positive period of $2\pi$?
A. $\sin x + \cos x$
B. $\sin x \cos x$
C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$
D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

Response:

Let's analyze each option:

**A.  $\sin x + \cos x$**

* Recall the angle addition formula: $\sin(x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y$
* We can rewrite the function as: 
   √2 (sin x (1/√2) + cos x (1/√2)) = √2 sin(x + π/4) 
* Since the sine function has a period of 2π, this function also has a period of **2π**.

**B. $\sin x \cos x$**

* Recall the double angle formula: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)
* We can rewrite the function as: (1/2)sin(2x)
* Since the sine function has a period of 2π, sin(2x) has a period of π.  Therefore, this function has a period of **π**.

**C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$**

* This is the Pythagorean identity:  sin²x + cos²x = 1
* This function is a constant function and therefore does **not** have a period.

**D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$**

* Recall the double angle formula: cos(2x) = cos²x - sin²x
* We can rewrite the function as: -cos(2x)
* Since the cosine function has a period of 2π, cos(2x) has a period of π. Therefore, this function has a period of **π**.

**Therefore, the function with a minimum positive period of 2π is  $\boxed{\text{A. } \sin x + \cos x}$.**

Prompt: Define a set $\Omega$, whose elements are sets of points in space. For any $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist real numbers $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$, not all zero, such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$. Given that $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, what is the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not \in \Omega$?
A. $(0,0,0)$
B. $(-1,0,0)$
C. $(0,1,0)$
D. $(0,0,-1)$

Response:

Let's break down the problem and analyze the given information:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Set Ω:**  We have a set Ω where each element is itself a set of points in 3D space. 
* **Linear Dependence:** The condition  `λ₁OP₁ + λ₂OP₂ + λ₃OP₃ = 0`  (with not all λs being zero) implies that for any three sets of points in Ω, the vectors from the origin (O) to those points are linearly dependent. In simpler terms, they lie on the same plane passing through the origin.

**Given Information**

* **(1, 0, 0) ∈ Ω:** This tells us there's at least one set of points in Ω that includes the point (1, 0, 0).

**Goal**

We need to find the condition that guarantees (0, 0, 1) is NOT in any set within Ω.

**Reasoning**

If (0, 0, 1) were to be part of some set in Ω, it would need to maintain the linear dependence property with all other sets in Ω, including the one containing (1, 0, 0).

Consider the vectors:

* **OA = (1, 0, 0)** 
* **OB = (0, 0, 1)**

These two vectors are linearly independent (they don't lie on the same line passing through the origin). To maintain the linear dependence property of sets in Ω, we need a third vector **OC** such that:

* **OC** lies on the same plane as **OA** and **OB**.
* **OC** is part of a set in Ω.

The only way to ensure that **OB** (and therefore (0, 0, 1)) cannot be part of any set in Ω is if all other possible vectors **OC** that could complete the linear dependence are excluded from being in any set within Ω.

**The Solution**

The vector **OC = (0, 0, -1)** lies on the same plane as **OA** and **OB**.  If (0, 0, -1) is part of any set in Ω, then the linear dependence condition would allow (0, 0, 1) to also be part of a set in Ω.

Therefore, to guarantee (0, 0, 1) ∉ Ω, we need to ensure **(0, 0, -1) ∉ Ω**.

**Answer**

$\boxed{\text{D. (0, 0, -1)}}$

A. $f(x)$ is an even function
B. $f(x)$ reaches its maximum at $x=2$
C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing
D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$

**Understanding the Set M**

* **The definition:**  The set $M$ contains all values $x_0$ such that:
    * $x_0$ is a real number.
    * For all $x$ in the interval $(-\infty, x_0)$, the function value $f(x)$ is strictly less than $f(x_0)$.

* **In simpler terms:**  A number $x_0$ belongs to the set $M$ if the function $f(x)$ is always smaller to the left of $x_0$ than it is at $x_0$ itself. This means $f(x)$ must be increasing as we approach $x_0$ from the left.

**M = [-1, 1]: Implications**

We are given that $M = [-1, 1]$. This tells us:

* **For every $x_0$ in [-1, 1]:**  The function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing as we approach $x_0$ from the left.
* **For every $x_0$ less than -1:** The function $f(x)$ does not have the property described above. In other words, there exists some $x$ to the left of $x_0$ where $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to $f(x_0)$.

**Analyzing the Options**

* **A. $f(x)$ is an even function:**  Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. The given information about $M$ doesn't guarantee this symmetry. For example, $f(x) = x^3$ for $x \le 1$ and any increasing function for $x > 1$ satisfies the condition but is not even. So, this is not necessarily true.

* **B. $f(x)$ reaches its maximum at $x=2$:** The set $M$ only provides information about the behavior of $f(x)$ up to $x = 1$. We have no information about what happens for $x > 1$. So, this is not necessarily true.

* **C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing:** While the definition of $M$ implies $f(x)$ is increasing for $x \le 1$, it doesn't guarantee strict increase. The function could have constant sections within the interval [-1, 1]. So, this is not necessarily true.

* **D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$:** Since $M = [-1, 1]$, for any value slightly less than -1, there must be some points to its left where the function is greater than or equal to its value at that point. This means $f(x)$ cannot have a local minimum at $x = -1$. So, this is **false**.

**Conclusion**

Based on our analysis, the only statement we can definitively say is false is **D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$**.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{D}}$.

Prompt: As shown in the figure, P-ABCD is a regular square pyramid, and O is the center of the base ABCD.
(1) If $AP = 5$, $AD=3√2$, find the volume of the geometric body formed by rotating $\triangle POA$ around PO for one complete revolution?
(2) If $AP=AD$, E is the midpoint of PB, find the angle between line BD and plane AEC?

Response:

## Solution

**(1)**

* **Step 1: Visualize the solid of revolution.**

Rotating triangle POA around PO forms a cone.

size(180);
currentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);
triple A,B,C,D,P,O;
O=(0,0,0);
A=(1,0,0);
B=(1,1,0);
C=(0,1,0);
D=(0,0,0);
P=(0.5,0.5,1.5);
draw(B--P--D--cycle);

label("$A$",A,S);
label("$B$",B,E);
label("$C$",C,N);
label("$D$",D,W);
label("$P$",P,N);
label("$O$",O,S);
[/asy]

* **Step 2: Find the radius and height of the cone.**

The radius of the cone is OA. Since ABCD is a square with side length 3√2, we have OA = (1/2)AD = (3√2)/2.

The height of the cone is PO.  We can find PO using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle POA:

PO = √(PA² - OA²) = √(5² - ((3√2)/2)²) = √(25 - 9/2) = √(41/2)

* **Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cone.**

The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.  Therefore, the volume of the cone is:

(1/3)π((3√2)/2)²(√(41/2)) = **(9π√41)/4**

**(2)**

* **Step 1: Visualize the angle.**

We want to find the angle between line BD and plane AEC.  To do this, we can find the angle between BD and a line in plane AEC that is perpendicular to the intersection of BD and plane AEC.

label("$P$",P,N);
label("$O$",O,S);
label("$E$",E,NE);
label("$F$",F,S);
[/asy]

* **Step 2: Find a suitable line in plane AEC.**

Since E is the midpoint of PB, line OE lies in plane AEC and is perpendicular to BD.  (This is because diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other.)

* **Step 3: Find the angle between BD and OE.**

Let F be the intersection of BD and OE.  We want to find angle BFO.

Since AP = AD, triangle PAD is isosceles, and PO is an altitude.  Therefore, PO bisects AD, and OF = (1/2)OD = (1/4)BD.

Since E is the midpoint of PB, we have OE = (1/2)PB.

Now consider right triangle BOF.  We have:

cos(BFO) = BF/BO = (BO - OF)/BO = (BO - (1/4)BD)/BO = 1 - (1/4)(BD/BO)

Since triangle BOD is a 45-45-90 triangle, we have BD/BO = √2.  Therefore:

cos(BFO) = 1 - (1/4)√2 = (4 - √2)/4

* **Step 4: Calculate the angle.**

Finally, we have:

BFO = arccos((4 - √2)/4)

Therefore, the angle between line BD and plane AEC is **$\boxed{\arccos\left(\frac{4-\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)}$**.

Prompt: If $f(x)=\log_a x(a>0, a \neq 1)$.
(1) $y=f(x)$ passes through $(4,2)$, find the solution set of $f(2x-2)<f(x)$?
(2) There exists an $x$ such that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence, find the range of values for $a$?

Response:

## Solution

**(1)** Since $y = f(x)$ passes through $(4,2)$, we have $f(4) = 2$.  Substituting into the function, we get $\log_a 4 = 2$.  Therefore, $a^2 = 4$ and since $a > 0$, we have $a = 2$.

Now we want to solve the inequality $f(2x-2) < f(x)$, which is equivalent to $\log_2 (2x-2) < \log_2 x$. Since the logarithm function is strictly increasing for $a > 1$, this inequality is equivalent to 
 $$2x-2 < x \quad \text{and} \quad 2x-2 > 0.$$ Solving these inequalities, we get $x < 2$ and $x > 1$.  Therefore, the solution set is $\boxed{1 < x < 2}$.

**(2)**  We are given that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence.  This means that 
 $$f(ax) - f(x+1) = f(x+2) - f(ax).$$ Substituting the function, we get
 $$\log_a (ax) - \log_a (x+1) = \log_a (x+2) - \log_a (ax).$$ Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to
 $$\log_a \frac{ax}{x+1} = \log_a \frac{x+2}{ax}.$$ Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, this implies
 $$\frac{ax}{x+1} = \frac{x+2}{ax}.$$ Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get
 $$a^2 x^2 = (x+1)(x+2).$$ Expanding the right side gives
 $$a^2 x^2 = x^2 + 3x + 2.$$ This simplifies to 
 $$(a^2 - 1)x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0.$$ For this quadratic to have a real solution for $x$, its discriminant must be nonnegative:
 $$(-3)^2 - 4(a^2-1)(-2) \ge 0.$$ This simplifies to $8a^2 - 1 \ge 0$, which factors as $(2\sqrt{2}a - 1)(2\sqrt{2}a + 1) \ge 0$.  Since $a > 0$, we have $a \ge \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$.

Therefore, the range of values for $a$ is $\boxed{a \ge \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}}$.

Prompt: To understand the relationship between physical exercise duration and academic performance of junior high school students in a certain area, 580 students were sampled from 29,000 students in the region. The data on daily average exercise duration and academic performance are shown in the following table:
(1) How many students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour?
(2) Estimate the daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region (accurate to 0.1)?
(3) Is there a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours? Note: $\chi^2 = \frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$, $P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05$.

Response:

Unfortunately, you haven't provided the table with the data on daily average exercise duration and academic performance. Please provide the table so I can help you answer the questions. 

However, I can give you the general steps on how to approach each question:

**(1) How many students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour?**

* **Step 1:** From the table (once provided), find the percentage of students in the sample who exercise for more than 1 hour.
* **Step 2:**  Multiply this percentage by the total number of students in the region (29,000) to estimate the number of students who exercise for more than 1 hour.

**(2) Estimate the daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region (accurate to 0.1)?**

* **Step 1:**  The table (once provided) likely shows different exercise duration categories and the number of students in each category. 
* **Step 2:** Calculate the midpoint of each exercise duration category (e.g., if the category is 30-60 minutes, the midpoint is 45 minutes).
* **Step 3:** Multiply the midpoint of each category by the number of students in that category.
* **Step 4:** Sum up the results from Step 3.
* **Step 5:** Divide the sum from Step 4 by the total number of students in the sample (580) to get the estimated average exercise duration.

**(3) Is there a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours?**

* **Step 1:** From the table (once provided), create a 2x2 contingency table:
    * Rows: Exercise duration (1-2 hours vs. other)
    * Columns: Academic performance (Excellent vs. other)
* **Step 2:** Calculate the Chi-square statistic using the formula provided and the values from your contingency table.
* **Step 3:** Determine the degrees of freedom (df) for your contingency table. For a 2x2 table, df = (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1) = 1.
* **Step 4:** Compare the calculated Chi-square statistic to the critical value provided (3.841). 
    * If the calculated Chi-square is greater than 3.841, then the p-value is less than 0.05, and you can reject the null hypothesis of no association. This means there is statistically significant evidence to suggest an association between exercise duration and academic performance.
    * If the calculated Chi-square is less than or equal to 3.841, then the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, and you fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to suggest an association. 

Please provide the table so I can help you calculate the specific answers.

Prompt: For the hyperbola $\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, $(b>0)$, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the left and right focal points, and line $l$ passing through point $M(-2,0)$ intersects the hyperbola $\Gamma$ at two points $P$ and $Q$, with point $P$ in the first quadrant,
(1) If $e=2$, find $b$?
(2) If $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $\triangle MA_2P$ is an isosceles triangle, find the coordinates of $P$?
(3) Draw a line through point $Q$ extending $OQ$ to intersect $\Gamma$ at point $R$. If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, find the range of values for $b$?

Response:

## Solution

**(1)** Since the hyperbola is centered at the origin and intersects the x-axis at $(\pm 1, 0)$, its semi-major axis is $a=1$.  We are given that the eccentricity $e=2$, and we know that $e = \frac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to each focus.  Therefore, $c = ae = 2$.  Finally, we can use the relationship $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$ to find $b$:

$$b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 = 3 \Rightarrow b = \sqrt{3}$$

Therefore, $b = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$.

**(2)** Since $b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$, we can find $c$ using $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 1 + \frac{16}{3} = \frac{19}{3}$, so $c = \frac{\sqrt{57}}{3}$.  The focal points are then $A_1 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{57}}{3}, 0 \right)$ and $A_2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{57}}{3}, 0 \right)$.

Let $P = (x,y)$. Since $\triangle MA_2P$ is isosceles, we have $MA_2 = PA_2$.  Using the distance formula, we get:

$$\sqrt{\left(-2 - \frac{\sqrt{57}}{3}\right)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{\sqrt{57}}{3}\right)^2 + y^2}$$

Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{61}{9} + \frac{4\sqrt{57}}{3} = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{2x\sqrt{57}}{3} + \frac{57}{9}$$

Since $P$ lies on the hyperbola, we also have:

$$x^2 - \frac{y^2}{8/3} = 1$$

Solving this equation for $y^2$ and substituting into the previous equation, we get a quadratic in $x$.  Solving this quadratic, we find that the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is $\frac{19\sqrt{57}}{57}$.  Substituting this value back into the equation for the hyperbola, we find the $y$-coordinate of $P$ to be $\frac{8\sqrt{19}}{9}$.

Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\boxed{\left(\frac{19\sqrt{57}}{57}, \frac{8\sqrt{19}}{9}\right)}$.

**(3)**  Let $R = (s,t)$. Since $Q$ and $R$ lie on line $l$, the slope of $l$ is given by both $\frac{t}{s+2}$ and $\frac{y}{x+2}$.  Setting these equal, we get:

$$\frac{t}{s+2} = \frac{y}{x+2}$$

Since $Q$ and $R$ lie on the hyperbola, we have:

$$x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

$$s^2 - \frac{t^2}{b^2} = 1$$

We are given that $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$.  This gives us:

$$\left(s + \sqrt{1+b^2}\right)\left(x - \sqrt{1+b^2}\right) + ty = 1$$

We now have four equations in the four unknowns $x$, $y$, $s$, and $t$.  Solving this system of equations (which is quite messy), we find that:

$$b^2 = \frac{4x^2}{(x+2)^2} - 1$$

Since $P$ lies in the first quadrant and on the hyperbola, we have $x > 1$.  Therefore, $b^2 > 0$.  Furthermore, as $x$ approaches infinity, $b^2$ approaches 3.  Therefore, the range of values for $b$ is $\boxed{(0, \sqrt{3})}$.

Answer:(1) $b=\sqrt{3}$ (2) $P(2,2\sqrt{2})$ (3) $b \in (0, \sqrt{3})$

#### 21
Prompt: For a function $f(x)$ and a point $M(a,b)$, let $s(x)=(x-a)^2+(f(x)-b)^2$. If $P(x_0,f(x_0))$ is the point where $s(x)$ reaches its minimum value, then $P$ is called the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$.
(1) For $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, $D=(0,+\infty)$, prove that for point $M(1,0)$, there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$;
(2) For $f(x)=e^x$, $D=R$, $M(1,0)$, please determine whether there exists a point that is the nearest point of $M$ on $f(x)$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$;
(3) Suppose $f(x)$ has a derivative, and $g(x)$ is always positive on the domain $R$. Let points $M_1(t-1,f(t)-g(t))$, $M_2(t+1,f(t)+g(t))$. If for any $t \in R$, there exists a point $P$ that is the nearest point of both $M_1$ and $M_2$, try to determine the monotonicity of $f(x)$.

Response:

## Solution

**(1)** For $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ and $M(1,0)$, we have:

$$s(x) = (x-1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + \frac{1}{x^2}$$

To find the minimum value of $s(x)$, we take its derivative and set it equal to zero:

$$s'(x) = 2x - 2 - \frac{2}{x^3} = 0$$

Multiplying both sides by $x^3$ and simplifying, we get:

$$2x^4 - 2x^3 - 2 = 0$$

This equation has a solution at $x=1$. We can check that this is a minimum by looking at the second derivative:

$$s''(x) = 2 + \frac{6}{x^4} > 0 \text{ for all } x > 0$$

Since the second derivative is always positive, the function $s(x)$ has a minimum at $x=1$. Therefore, the point $P\left(1, \frac{1}{1}\right) = (1,1)$ is the nearest point of $M(1,0)$ on the curve $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

**(2)** For $f(x) = e^x$ and $M(1,0)$, we have:

$$s(x) = (x-1)^2 + (e^x)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + e^{2x}$$

Taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:

$$s'(x) = 2x - 2 + 2e^{2x} = 0$$

This equation does not have a closed-form solution. However, we can analyze the behavior of $s'(x)$. Notice that:

* $s'(x)$ is continuous for all $x$.
* $s'(x) \to -\infty$ as $x \to -\infty$.
* $s'(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.

By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one value of $x$ where $s'(x) = 0$. This means there exists a point $P$ on the curve $f(x) = e^x$ where the distance to $M(1,0)$ is minimized.

Now, let's check if the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$. The slope of the tangent line at $P(x_0, e^{x_0})$ is $f'(x_0) = e^{x_0}$. The slope of the line $MP$ is:

$$\frac{e^{x_0} - 0}{x_0 - 1} = \frac{e^{x_0}}{x_0 - 1}$$

For the lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1:

$$e^{x_0} \cdot \frac{e^{x_0}}{x_0 - 1} = -1$$

This simplifies to:

$$e^{2x_0} = -x_0 + 1$$

This equation does not hold true for any $x_0$. Therefore, the line $MP$ is not perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$.

**(3)** Since $P$ is the nearest point to both $M_1$ and $M_2$, the line segments $PM_1$ and $PM_2$ must be perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$. Let the x-coordinate of $P$ be $x = c$. Then, the slopes of $PM_1$ and $PM_2$ are:

$$m_{PM_1} = \frac{f(c) - (f(t) - g(t))}{c - (t-1)} = \frac{f(c) - f(t) + g(t)}{c - t + 1}$$

$$m_{PM_2} = \frac{f(c) - (f(t) + g(t))}{c - (t+1)} = \frac{f(c) - f(t) - g(t)}{c - t - 1}$$

The slope of the tangent line at $P$ is $f'(c)$. Since both $PM_1$ and $PM_2$ are perpendicular to the tangent, we have:

$$f'(c) \cdot m_{PM_1} = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad f'(c) \cdot m_{PM_2} = -1$$

Substituting the expressions for the slopes and simplifying, we get:

$$f'(c) \left(\frac{f(c) - f(t) + g(t)}{c - t + 1}\right) = -1$$

$$f'(c) \left(\frac{f(c) - f(t) - g(t)}{c - t - 1}\right) = -1$$

Since these two equations hold for any $t$, we can equate the left-hand sides:

$$\frac{f'(c)(f(c) - f(t) + g(t))}{c - t + 1} = \frac{f'(c)(f(c) - f(t) - g(t))}{c - t - 1}$$

Since $g(x) > 0$, the only way for this equation to hold for all $t$ is if $f'(c) = 0$. This means that the tangent line at $P$ is horizontal.

Since this is true for any $t$, it means that the function $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent line at the x-coordinate of the nearest point for any pair of points $M_1$ and $M_2$ defined as above. This implies that $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, and therefore, $f(x)$ is a constant function.

## Final Answers

**(1)** The nearest point exists and is $\boxed{(1,1)}$.

**(2)** The nearest point exists, but the line $MP$ is not perpendicular to the tangent line at $P$.

**(3)** The function $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\text{constant}}$.
