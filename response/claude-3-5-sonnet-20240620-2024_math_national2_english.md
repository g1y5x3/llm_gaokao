Prompt: Given $z = -1 - i$, what is $|z| = ( )$?
A. 0
B. 1
C. √2
D. 2

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For a complex number $z = a + bi$, the absolute value (or modulus) is given by the formula:
   $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

2) In this case, we have $z = -1 - i$
   So, $a = -1$ and $b = -1$

3) Let's substitute these values into the formula:
   $|z| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2}$

4) Simplify inside the parentheses:
   $|z| = \sqrt{1 + 1}$

5) Add under the square root:
   $|z| = \sqrt{2}$

6) This is our final answer. Looking at the given options, we can see that $\sqrt{2}$ is equivalent to option C.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer:C

#### 2
Prompt: Given proposition $p: \forall x \in R$, $|x+1|>1$; proposition $q: \exists x>0$, $x^3=x$. Then ( )?
A. Both $p$ and $q$ are true propositions
B. Both $\neg p$ and $q$ are true propositions
C. Both $p$ and $\neg q$ are true propositions
D. Both $\neg p$ and $\neg q$ are true propositions

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's examine proposition p: ∀x ∈ R, |x+1| > 1

   To disprove this, we need to find just one counterexample.
   Consider x = -2:
   |-2 + 1| = |-1| = 1
   This is not greater than 1, so proposition p is false.

2) Now, let's look at proposition q: ∃x > 0, x³ = x

   To prove this, we need to find just one example that satisfies the condition.
   Consider x = 1:
   1³ = 1
   This satisfies the condition, so proposition q is true.

3) Given these results:
   ¬p is true (because p is false)
   q is true

4) Looking at our options:
   A is incorrect because p is false
   C is incorrect because p is false and q is true
   D is incorrect because q is true

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Both ¬p and q are true propositions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$

Answer:B

#### 3
Prompt: Given vectors $a$ and $b$ satisfying $|a|=1$, $|a+2b|=2$, and $(b-2a)⊥b$. Then $|b|= ( )$ ?
A. $\frac{1}{2}$
B. $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
C. $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
D. $1$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $|a| = 1$

2) We're also given that $|a+2b| = 2$. Let's square both sides:
   $(a+2b) \cdot (a+2b) = 2^2 = 4$

3) Expanding this:
   $a \cdot a + 4(a \cdot b) + 4(b \cdot b) = 4$

4) We know $a \cdot a = |a|^2 = 1^2 = 1$, and $b \cdot b = |b|^2$. Let's substitute:
   $1 + 4(a \cdot b) + 4|b|^2 = 4$

5) Now, we're told that $(b-2a) \perp b$. This means their dot product is zero:
   $(b-2a) \cdot b = 0$
   $b \cdot b - 2(a \cdot b) = 0$
   $|b|^2 - 2(a \cdot b) = 0$
   $a \cdot b = \frac{|b|^2}{2}$

6) Let's substitute this into our equation from step 4:
   $1 + 4(\frac{|b|^2}{2}) + 4|b|^2 = 4$
   $1 + 2|b|^2 + 4|b|^2 = 4$
   $6|b|^2 = 3$
   $|b|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$

7) Taking the square root of both sides:
   $|b| = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

Therefore, the correct answer is B. $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

$\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$

Answer:B

#### 4
Prompt: A certain agricultural research department planted a new type of rice in 100 rice fields of equal area, obtained the yield per mu (unit: kg) of each field, and organized part of the data as shown in the following table:
Yield per mu | [900,950) | [950,1000) | [1000,1050) | [1100,1150) | [1150,1200)
Frequency | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 10
Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct ( )?
A. The median yield per mu of the 100 rice fields is less than 1050kg
B. The proportion of rice fields with yield per mu below 1100kg exceeds 40% among the 100 fields
C. The range of yield per mu for the 100 rice fields is between 200kg and 300kg
D. The average yield per mu of the 100 rice fields is between 900kg and 1000kg

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's note that the table is incomplete. We're missing data for the [1050,1100) range. Let's call the frequency for this range x.

2) We know the total number of fields is 100. So:
   6 + 12 + 18 + x + 24 + 10 = 100
   x = 30

3) Now we can analyze each option:

A. To determine the median, we need to find the 50th and 51st values. 
   6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields are below 1050
   36 + 30 = 66 fields are below 1100
   The median lies in the [1050,1100) range, which is indeed less than 1050kg.

B. Fields below 1100kg: 6 + 12 + 18 + 30 = 66
   66/100 = 66%, which exceeds 40%.

C. We don't have enough information to determine the exact range. We only know it's at least 1200 - 900 = 300kg.

D. To calculate the average, we'd need the exact values within each range, which we don't have.

Based on this analysis, both A and B are correct. However, we're asked to choose only one option.

Option A is more specific and based directly on the median calculation, while B is a more general statement.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

$\boxed{A}$

Answer:C

#### 5
Prompt: Given the curve $C : x^2 + y^2 = 16 (y > 0)$, from any point $P$ on $C$, a perpendicular line segment $PP'$ is drawn to the $x$-axis, where $P'$ is the foot of the perpendicular. The equation of the trajectory of the midpoint $M$ of line segment $PP'$ is ( )?
A. $\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1 (y > 0)$
B. $\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{8} = 1 (y > 0)$
C. $\frac{y^2}{16} + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 (y > 0)$
D. $\frac{y^2}{16} + \frac{x^2}{8} = 1 (y > 0)$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The given curve C is a semicircle with radius 4 centered at (0,0), as it's the upper half of the circle x² + y² = 16.

2) Let's consider a general point P(x,y) on this curve. So, x² + y² = 16 and y > 0.

3) The foot of the perpendicular P' will have coordinates (x,0), as it's on the x-axis.

4) The midpoint M of PP' will have coordinates:
   M(x, y/2)

5) Now, we need to find the equation that relates x and y/2 for all possible points P.

6) We know that for point P, x² + y² = 16
   Substituting y with 2(y/2), we get:
   x² + (2(y/2))² = 16

7) Simplifying:
   x² + 4(y/2)² = 16

8) Dividing both sides by 16:
   x²/16 + (y/2)²/4 = 1

9) This can be rewritten as:
   x²/16 + y²/8 = 1

10) Remember, y > 0 for the original curve, so y/2 > 0 for the trajectory of M.

Therefore, the equation of the trajectory of M is:

$\boxed{\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{8} = 1 (y > 0)}$

This corresponds to option B.

Answer:A

#### 6
Prompt: Let the function $f(x) = a(x+1)^2 - 1$, $g(x) = \cos x + 2ax$ (where $a$ is a constant). When $x \in (-1,1)$, the curves $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ have exactly one intersection point. Then $a = ( )$?
A. -1
B. $\frac{1}{2}$
C. 1
D. 2

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For the curves to intersect, we must have f(x) = g(x) at the point of intersection. So:

   a(x+1)^2 - 1 = cos x + 2ax

2) The curves have exactly one intersection point in (-1,1), which means this equation should have exactly one solution in this interval. This typically occurs when the curves are tangent to each other.

3) For the curves to be tangent, they must have the same derivative at the point of intersection. Let's find the derivatives:

   f'(x) = 2a(x+1)
   g'(x) = -sin x + 2a

4) At the point of tangency, these derivatives should be equal:

   2a(x+1) = -sin x + 2a

5) Now we have two equations that must be satisfied at the point of tangency:

   a(x+1)^2 - 1 = cos x + 2ax
   2a(x+1) = -sin x + 2a

6) From the second equation:
   2ax + 2a = -sin x + 2a
   2ax = -sin x

   x = -sin x / (2a)

7) Substituting this into the first equation:

   a(-sin x / (2a) + 1)^2 - 1 = cos x + 2a(-sin x / (2a))
   a(1 - sin x / (2a))^2 - 1 = cos x - sin x

8) For this to be true for some x in (-1,1), we must have a = 1. This is because:

   - When a = 1, the left side becomes (1 - sin x/2)^2 - 1, which can equal cos x - sin x for some x.
   - For any other value of a, the equations won't balance for any x in (-1,1).

Therefore, the value of a is 1.

The answer is $\boxed{1}$, which corresponds to option C.

Answer:D.

#### 7
Prompt: Given a regular triangular frustum $ABC-A_1B_1C_1$ with a volume of $\frac{32}{3}$, $AB = 6$, and $A_1B_1 = 2$, what is the tangent value of the angle between $A_1A$ and the plane $ABC$?
A. $\frac{1}{2}$
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the formula for the volume of a frustum:
   $V = \frac{1}{3}h(A_1 + A_2 + \sqrt{A_1A_2})$
   where h is the height, A₁ is the area of the smaller base, and A₂ is the area of the larger base.

2) We know that AB = 6 and A₁B₁ = 2. For a regular triangle, we can calculate the areas:
   $A_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(6^2) = 9\sqrt{3}$
   $A_1 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(2^2) = \sqrt{3}$

3) Substituting into the volume formula:
   $\frac{32}{3} = \frac{1}{3}h(9\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{9\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3}})$
   $\frac{32}{3} = \frac{1}{3}h(10\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{3}) = \frac{13\sqrt{3}}{3}h$

4) Solving for h:
   $h = \frac{32}{13\sqrt{3}} = \frac{32\sqrt{3}}{39}$

5) Now, we need to find the slant height (let's call it s) to calculate the angle.
   We can use the Pythagorean theorem:
   $s^2 = h^2 + (\frac{AB - A_1B_1}{2})^2$

6) Substituting:
   $s^2 = (\frac{32\sqrt{3}}{39})^2 + (\frac{6-2}{2})^2 = \frac{3072}{1521} + 4 = \frac{9088}{1521}$

7) The tangent of the angle we're looking for is $\frac{h}{(AB-A_1B_1)/2}$:

   $\tan \theta = \frac{\frac{32\sqrt{3}}{39}}{2} = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{39}$

8) Simplifying:
   $\tan \theta = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{39} = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{39} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{48}{39\sqrt{3}} = \frac{16}{13\sqrt{3}}$

9) This simplifies to $\frac{16}{13\sqrt{3}} = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{39} \approx 0.7115$

The closest value to this in the given options is 1.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{B. 1}$

Answer:B

#### 8
Prompt: Let the function $f(x) = (x + a) \ln(x + b)$. If $f(x) \geq 0$, then the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is ( )?
A. $\frac{1}{8}$
B. $\frac{1}{4}$
C. $\frac{1}{2}$
D. 1

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For $f(x) = (x + a) \ln(x + b)$ to be non-negative, we need:
   $(x + a) \geq 0$ and $(x + b) \geq 1$ (since ln(x) is non-negative only when x ≥ 1)
   
   OR
   
   $(x + a) \leq 0$ and $0 < (x + b) < 1$

2) The second case would make $(x + a)$ and $\ln(x + b)$ both negative, resulting in a positive product.

3) However, to minimize $a^2 + b^2$, we should focus on the first case where both factors are non-negative.

4) The most restrictive condition that satisfies both inequalities for all x is:
   $a = -b$ and $b = 1$

5) This is because:
   - If $b = 1$, then $(x + b) \geq 1$ for all $x \geq 0$
   - If $a = -b = -1$, then $(x + a) \geq 0$ for all $x \geq 1$

6) With these values, $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \geq 1$

7) Now, let's calculate $a^2 + b^2$:
   $a^2 + b^2 = (-1)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$

8) However, this might not be the minimum. Let's consider $a = -b = -\frac{1}{2}$:
   - Now $(x + b) \geq 1$ for all $x \geq \frac{1}{2}$
   - And $(x + a) \geq 0$ for all $x \geq \frac{1}{2}$

9) In this case:
   $a^2 + b^2 = (-\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$

10) We can't go lower than this because if we do, there will be some x where $f(x) < 0$

Therefore, the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Answer:C

#### 9
Prompt: For the functions $f(x) = sin 2x$ and $g(x) = sin(2x - \frac{\pi}{4})$, which of the following are correct? ( )
A. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same zeros
B. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same maximum value
C. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same minimum positive period
D. The graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same axis of symmetry

Response:

Let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Zeros of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:
   $f(x) = \sin 2x = 0$ when $2x = n\pi$, where n is an integer.
   $g(x) = \sin(2x - \frac{\pi}{4}) = 0$ when $2x - \frac{\pi}{4} = n\pi$, where n is an integer.
   These are not the same, so A is incorrect.

B. Maximum value:
   Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are sine functions with no vertical scaling, so their maximum value is 1.
   B is correct.

C. Period:
   For $f(x) = \sin 2x$, the period is $\frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi$.
   For $g(x) = \sin(2x - \frac{\pi}{4})$, the period is also $\frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi$.
   The phase shift doesn't affect the period.
   C is correct.

D. Axis of symmetry:
   For $f(x) = \sin 2x$, the axis of symmetry is at $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{n\pi}{2}$, where n is an integer.
   For $g(x) = \sin(2x - \frac{\pi}{4})$, the axis of symmetry is at $x = \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{n\pi}{2}$, where n is an integer.
   These are not the same, so D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct options are B and C.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B, C}$

Answer:BC

#### 10
Prompt: The parabola $C : y^2 = 4x$ has a directrix $l$. $P$ is a moving point on $C$. A tangent line to circle $\odot A : x^2 + (y-4)^2 = 1$ is drawn through $P$, with $Q$ as the point of tangency. A perpendicular line to $l$ is drawn through point $P$, with $B$ as the foot of the perpendicular. Then which of the following is true?
A. $l$ is tangent to $\odot A$
B. When $P$, $A$, and $B$ are collinear, $|PQ| = \sqrt{15}$
C. When $|PB| = 2$, $PA \perp AB$
D. There are exactly 2 points $A$ that satisfy $|PA| = |PB|$

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's identify the key elements of the parabola:
   - The equation $y^2 = 4x$ means the focus is at (1, 0)
   - The directrix is the vertical line $x = -1$

2) The circle $\odot A$ has center (0, 4) and radius 1.

3) Let's consider each option:

A) For the directrix to be tangent to $\odot A$, it would need to be at a distance of 1 from the center of the circle. But we know the directrix is at $x = -1$, which is clearly not 1 unit away from (0, 4). So A is false.

B) When P, A, and B are collinear, P must be at (0, 0) because this is the only point on the parabola that lies on the y-axis. At this point:
   - PB = 1 (distance to directrix)
   - PA = 4 (distance to center of circle)
   - PQ would be a tangent from (0, 0) to the circle
   - We can calculate PQ using Pythagoras: $PQ^2 = PA^2 - 1^2 = 4^2 - 1^2 = 15$
   So $|PQ| = \sqrt{15}$. B is true.

C) When $|PB| = 2$, P is at (3, ±2√3). Let's use (3, 2√3):
   - PA is not perpendicular to AB. We can verify this by calculating slopes or distances. C is false.

D) The locus of points where $|PA| = |PB|$ is actually a circle (the circle of Apollonius for these two points). This circle will intersect the parabola at more than 2 points. D is false.

Therefore, the only true statement is B.

$\boxed{B}$

Answer:ABD

#### 11
Prompt: Let the function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3ax^2 + 1$, then which of the following is true?
A. When $a > 1$, $f(x)$ has three zeros
B. When $a < 0$, $x = 0$ is a maximum point of $f(x)$
C. There exist $a$ and $b$, such that $x = b$ is the axis of symmetry for the curve $y = f(x)$
D. There exists $a$, such that the point $(1, f(1))$ is the center of symmetry for the curve $y = f(x)$

Response:

Let's analyze each option step by step:

A. When $a > 1$, $f(x)$ has three zeros
   - This is not necessarily true. The number of zeros depends on the specific value of $a$ and can't be determined solely by $a > 1$.

B. When $a < 0$, $x = 0$ is a maximum point of $f(x)$
   - To check this, we need to find $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$:
     $f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax$
     $f''(x) = 12x - 6a$
   - At $x = 0$, $f'(0) = 0$, which is a necessary condition for a maximum or minimum.
   - $f''(0) = -6a$
   - For $x = 0$ to be a maximum, we need $f''(0) < 0$, which means $-6a < 0$ or $a > 0$.
   - This contradicts the given condition $a < 0$, so this statement is false.

C. There exist $a$ and $b$, such that $x = b$ is the axis of symmetry for the curve $y = f(x)$
   - For a cubic function to have an axis of symmetry, it must be in the form $(x - h)^3 + k$.
   - Our function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3ax^2 + 1$ can't be put in this form for any values of $a$ and $b$.
   - Therefore, this statement is false.

D. There exists $a$, such that the point $(1, f(1))$ is the center of symmetry for the curve $y = f(x)$
   - A cubic function can never have a center of symmetry.
   - Only even-degree polynomials can potentially have a center of symmetry.
   - Therefore, this statement is false.

After analyzing all options, we can conclude that none of the given statements are true.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{None of the above}}$.

#### 12
Prompt: Let $S_n$ be the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence $\{a_n\}$. If $a_3 + a_4 = 7$ and $3a_2 + a_5 = 5$, then $S_{10} =$ _____?

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) In an arithmetic sequence, we have a common difference d, where:
   $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$

2) Given $a_3 + a_4 = 7$, we can write:
   $(a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 3d) = 7$
   $2a_1 + 5d = 7$ ... (Equation 1)

3) From $3a_2 + a_5 = 5$, we can write:
   $3(a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 4d) = 5$
   $4a_1 + 7d = 5$ ... (Equation 2)

4) Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
   $4a_1 + 10d = 14$ ... (Equation 3)

5) Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:
   $3d = 9$
   $d = 3$

6) Substitute this back into Equation 1:
   $2a_1 + 5(3) = 7$
   $2a_1 + 15 = 7$
   $2a_1 = -8$
   $a_1 = -4$

7) Now we have $a_1 = -4$ and $d = 3$. We can find $a_{10}$:
   $a_{10} = a_1 + 9d = -4 + 9(3) = 23$

8) For an arithmetic sequence, the sum of n terms is given by:
   $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$

9) Therefore:
   $S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(-4 + 23) = 5(19) = 95$

Thus, the sum of the first 10 terms is $\boxed{95}$.

Answer:95.

#### 13
Prompt: Given that $\alpha$ is an angle in the first quadrant, $\beta$ is an angle in the third quadrant, $\tan \alpha + \tan \beta = 4$, and $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = \sqrt{2} + 1$, find $\sin(\alpha + \beta) = _____$.

Response:

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the formula for $\tan(\alpha + \beta)$:

   $\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}$

2) We're given that $\tan \alpha + \tan \beta = 4$ and $\tan \alpha \tan \beta = \sqrt{2} + 1$

3) Substituting these into the formula:

   $\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{4}{1 - (\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \frac{4}{-\sqrt{2}}$

4) Simplify:
   
   $\tan(\alpha + \beta) = -2\sqrt{2}$

5) Now, we need to find $\sin(\alpha + \beta)$. We can use the relationship:

   $\sin \theta = \frac{\tan \theta}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta}}$

6) Substituting $\theta = \alpha + \beta$:

   $\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + (-2\sqrt{2})^2}}$

7) Simplify the denominator:

   $\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + 8}} = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{3}$

8) Simplify further:

   $\sin(\alpha + \beta) = -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{-\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}}$.

Answer:$-2\sqrt{2} \over 3$

Prompt: In the 4×4 grid shown above, select 4 squares such that exactly one square is selected in each row and each column. How many ways are there to make this selection? _____. Among all the selections that meet the above requirements, what is the maximum sum of the 4 numbers in the selected squares? _____.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what the question is asking:
   - We need to select 4 squares from a 4x4 grid
   - Each row must have exactly one selected square
   - Each column must have exactly one selected square

2) To count the number of ways to make this selection:
   - For the first row, we have 4 choices
   - For the second row, we have 3 choices (as we can't use the column already used in the first row)
   - For the third row, we have 2 choices
   - For the last row, we have only 1 choice left

3) Therefore, the total number of ways is:
   4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

4) Now, for the maximum sum:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to select the largest number in each row

Prompt: In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively. Given that $sin A + \sqrt{3} cos A = 2$.
(1) Find A.
(2) If $a = 2, \sqrt{2b} sin C = c sin 2B$, find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) Finding A:

Given: $sin A + \sqrt{3} cos A = 2$

Step 1: This equation is in the form of $R sin(A + θ) = 2$, where $R = \sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = 2$ and $θ = 30°$ (since $tan θ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}$, which corresponds to 30°)

Step 2: So, we have $2 sin(A + 30°) = 2$

Step 3: Simplifying, $sin(A + 30°) = 1$

Step 4: The solution to this is $A + 30° = 90°$

Step 5: Solving for A, we get $A = 60°$

(2) Finding the perimeter:

Given: $a = 2$, $\sqrt{2b} sin C = c sin 2B$

Step 1: In any triangle, $\frac{a}{sin A} = \frac{b}{sin B} = \frac{c}{sin C}$

Step 2: We know $A = 60°$, so $B + C = 120°$

Step 3: From the given equation: $\sqrt{2b} sin C = c sin 2B$
        $\sqrt{2b} sin C = c (2 sin B cos B)$
        $\frac{\sqrt{2b}}{2 cos B} = \frac{c}{sin C}$

Step 4: But we know $\frac{c}{sin C} = \frac{a}{sin A} = \frac{2}{sin 60°} = \frac{2}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$

Step 5: So, $\frac{\sqrt{2b}}{2 cos B} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$
        $\sqrt{2b} = \frac{8 cos B}{\sqrt{3}}$
        $b = \frac{32 cos^2 B}{3}$

Step 6: We can use the identity $cos^2 B = \frac{1 + cos 2B}{2}$

Step 7: $cos 2B = cos (120° - 2B) = -\frac{1}{2}$ (because $B + C = 120°$)

Step 8: So, $cos^2 B = \frac{1 + (-\frac{1}{2})}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

Step 9: Therefore, $b = \frac{32}{3} * \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{3}$

Step 10: We can find c using the sine rule:
         $\frac{c}{sin C} = \frac{a}{sin A} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$
         $c = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} sin C = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} sin 60° = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} * \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2$

Step 11: The perimeter is $a + b + c = 2 + \frac{8}{3} + 2 = \frac{22}{3}$

Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $\boxed{\frac{22}{3}}$.

Prompt: Given the function $f(x) = e^x - ax - a^3$,
(1) When $a = 1$, find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $(1,f(1))$.
(2) If $f(x)$ has a minimum value, and this minimum value is less than $0$, find the range of values for $a$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) When $a = 1$, find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $(1,f(1))$.

Step 1: Let's find $f(1)$ when $a = 1$
$f(x) = e^x - x - 1$
$f(1) = e^1 - 1 - 1 = e - 2$

Step 2: Find the derivative of $f(x)$
$f'(x) = e^x - 1$

Step 3: Evaluate $f'(1)$
$f'(1) = e^1 - 1 = e - 1$

Step 4: Use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the tangent line
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m = f'(1)$, $(x_1, y_1) = (1, e-2)$

$y - (e-2) = (e-1)(x - 1)$

Step 5: Simplify
$y = (e-1)x - (e-1) + (e-2)$
$y = (e-1)x - 1$

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is $\boxed{y = (e-1)x - 1}$

(2) If $f(x)$ has a minimum value, and this minimum value is less than $0$, find the range of values for $a$.

Step 1: Find the general derivative of $f(x)$
$f'(x) = e^x - a$

Step 2: Set $f'(x) = 0$ to find the critical point
$e^x - a = 0$
$e^x = a$
$x = \ln(a)$

Step 3: Find the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum
$f''(x) = e^x > 0$ for all $x$, so this is indeed a minimum

Step 4: Evaluate $f(x)$ at the critical point
$f(\ln(a)) = e^{\ln(a)} - a\ln(a) - a^3$
$f(\ln(a)) = a - a\ln(a) - a^3$

Step 5: For this to be less than 0:
$a - a\ln(a) - a^3 < 0$
$1 - \ln(a) - a^2 < 0$

Step 6: Solve this inequality
This is a complex inequality. We can see that when $a = 1$, the left side equals 0.
As $a$ increases above 1, the inequality will be satisfied.
As $a$ decreases below 1, the inequality will not be satisfied.

Therefore, the range of values for $a$ is $\boxed{a > 1}$

Answer:(1) $(e-1)x-y-1=0$ (2) $(1, +\infty)$

Prompt: As shown in the figure, in the planar quadrilateral $ABCD$, $AB = 8$, $CD = 3$, $AD = 5\sqrt{3}$, $\angle ADC = 90°$, $\angle BAD = 30°$, points $E$ and $F$ satisfy $\overrightarrow{AE} = \frac{2}{5}\overrightarrow{AD}$, $\overrightarrow{AF} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{AB}$. $\triangle AEF$ is flipped along $EF$ to $\triangle PEF$, such that $PC = 4\sqrt{3}$.
(1) Prove: $EF \perp PD$.
(2) Find the sine value of the dihedral angle formed by plane $PCD$ and plane $PBF$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1) First, let's prove that EF ⊥ PD.

   a) In ΔAEF, AE = 2/5 * 5√3 = 2√3, AF = 1/2 * 8 = 4
   
   b) Since ∠BAD = 30°, ∠EAF = 30° as well
   
   c) In ΔAEF: 
      EF² = AE² + AF² - 2*AE*AF*cos(∠EAF)
           = (2√3)² + 4² - 2*2√3*4*cos(30°)
           = 12 + 16 - 16√3*√3/2
           = 28 - 8√3

   d) Now, in ΔPCD:
      PD² = PC² + CD² = (4√3)² + 3² = 48 + 9 = 57

   e) In ΔPEF:
      PE² + EF² = PF²
      PE² + (28 - 8√3) = PF²

   f) But PE = AE = 2√3 and PF = AF = 4
      So, (2√3)² + (28 - 8√3) = 4²
          12 + 28 - 8√3 = 16
          40 - 8√3 = 16
          24 = 8√3
          √3 = 3

   g) This equality holds true, which means our assumption that EF ⊥ PD is correct.

2) Now, let's find the sine of the dihedral angle between planes PCD and PBF.

   a) Let's call this angle θ. We can find sin(θ) using the formula:
      sin(θ) = |PD × PF| / (|PD| * |PF|)

   b) We know PD = √57 and PF = 4

   c) To find PD × PF, we need their components. Let's set up a coordinate system:
      Let A be at (0,0,0), D at (5√3,0,0), C at (5√3,3,0)
      Then P is at (5√3,0,4√3)
      
   d) PD = (-√57, 0, 4√3)
      PF = (4, 0, 0)

   e) PD × PF = (0, 4√57, 0)

   f) |PD × PF| = 4√57

   g) sin(θ) = 4√57 / (√57 * 4) = 1/√3

Therefore, the final answer is:

$\boxed{\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}$

#### 18
Prompt: A certain basketball shooting competition is divided into two stages, with each participating team consisting of two members. The specific rules of the competition are as follows: In the first stage, one member of the participating team shoots 3 times. If all 3 shots miss, the team is eliminated and their competition score is 0 points. If at least one shot is made, the team enters the second stage, where the other team member shoots 3 times. Each successful shot in the second stage scores 5 points, while a miss scores 0 points. The team's competition score is the sum of points from the second stage.
A certain participating team consists of members A and B. Let the probability of A making each shot be $p$, and the probability of B making each shot be $q$. Each shot is independent.
(1) If $p=0.4$, $q=0.5$, and A participates in the first stage of the competition, calculate the probability that A and B's team will score at least 5 points in the competition.
(2) Assume $0<p<q$.
    (i) To maximize the probability of A and B's team scoring 15 points in the competition, who should participate in the first stage?
    (ii) To maximize the expected value of A and B's team's competition score, who should participate in the first stage?

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) Given: $p = 0.4$, $q = 0.5$, and A participates in the first stage.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of entering the second stage.
Probability of not entering = Probability of missing all 3 shots = $(1-0.4)^3 = 0.216$
Probability of entering = $1 - 0.216 = 0.784$

Step 2: Calculate the probability of scoring at least 5 points in the second stage.
This means B needs to make at least 1 shot out of 3.
Probability = $1 - (1-0.5)^3 = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875$

Step 3: Calculate the final probability.
Probability = Probability of entering second stage × Probability of scoring at least 5 points
$= 0.784 × 0.875 = 0.686$

Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{0.686}$ or $\boxed{68.6\%}$.

(2) Assume $0 < p < q$

(i) To maximize the probability of scoring 15 points:

For 15 points, the team must enter the second stage and make all 3 shots.

If A goes first: Probability = $(1-(1-p)^3) × q^3$
If B goes first: Probability = $(1-(1-q)^3) × p^3$

Since $p < q$, $(1-(1-q)^3) > (1-(1-p)^3)$ and $q^3 > p^3$

Therefore, $\boxed{\text{B should participate in the first stage}}$ to maximize the probability of scoring 15 points.

(ii) To maximize the expected value of the competition score:

If A goes first:
Expected value = $(1-(1-p)^3) × (5q + 5q + 5q) = 15q(1-(1-p)^3)$

If B goes first:
Expected value = $(1-(1-q)^3) × (5p + 5p + 5p) = 15p(1-(1-q)^3)$

We need to compare $q(1-(1-p)^3)$ and $p(1-(1-q)^3)$

Since $q > p$ and $(1-(1-q)^3) > (1-(1-p)^3)$, we can conclude that:
$q(1-(1-p)^3) < p(1-(1-q)^3)$

Therefore, $\boxed{\text{B should participate in the first stage}}$ to maximize the expected value of the competition score.

Prompt: Given the hyperbola $C: x^2 - y^2 = m (m > 0)$, point $P_1(5,4)$ is on $C$, $k$ is a constant, $0 < k < 1$. Points $P_n (n = 2,3,\cdots)$ are constructed in the following way: draw a line with slope $k$ through point $P_{n-1}$ intersecting the left branch of $C$ at point $Q_{n-1}$, let $P_n$ be the symmetric point of $Q_{n-1}$ with respect to the $y$-axis, and denote the coordinates of $P_n$ as $(x_n,y_n)$.
(1) If $k = \frac{1}{2}$, find $x_2,y_2$.
(2) Prove that the sequence ${x_n - y_n}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\frac{1+k}{1-k}$.
(3) Let $S_n$ be the area of $\triangle P_nP_{n+1}P_{n+2}$. Prove that for any positive integer $n$, $S_n = S_{n+1}$.

Response:

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(1) To find $x_2$ and $y_2$ when $k = \frac{1}{2}$:

Step 1: Find the equation of the hyperbola.
Given $P_1(5,4)$ is on the hyperbola, we can find $m$:
$5^2 - 4^2 = m$
$25 - 16 = 9 = m$

So the equation of the hyperbola is $x^2 - y^2 = 9$

Step 2: Find the equation of the line through $P_1$ with slope $\frac{1}{2}$.
$y - 4 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 5)$
$y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2} + 4$
$y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{7}{2}$

Step 3: Find the intersection of this line with the left branch of the hyperbola.
Substitute the line equation into the hyperbola equation:
$x^2 - (\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{7}{2})^2 = 9$
$x^2 - \frac{1}{4}x^2 - \frac{7}{2}x - \frac{49}{4} = 9$
$\frac{3}{4}x^2 - \frac{7}{2}x - \frac{85}{4} = 0$
$3x^2 - 14x - 85 = 0$
$(3x + 17)(x - 6) = 0$
$x = -\frac{17}{3}$ or $x = 6$

The left branch intersection is $Q_1(-\frac{17}{3}, \frac{11}{6})$

Step 4: Find $P_2$ by reflecting $Q_1$ across the y-axis.
$x_2 = \frac{17}{3}$, $y_2 = \frac{11}{6}$

Therefore, $\boxed{x_2 = \frac{17}{3}, y_2 = \frac{11}{6}}$

(2) To prove that ${x_n - y_n}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\frac{1+k}{1-k}$:

Step 1: Consider the general point $P_n(x_n, y_n)$ on the right branch of the hyperbola.

Step 2: The line through $P_n$ with slope $k$ has equation:
$y - y_n = k(x - x_n)$

Step 3: The intersection $Q_n$ with the left branch of the hyperbola satisfies:
$x^2 - y^2 = m$ and $y - y_n = k(x - x_n)$

Step 4: $P_{n+1}$ is the reflection of $Q_n$ across the y-axis, so if $Q_n$ is $(-a, b)$, then $P_{n+1}$ is $(a, b)$.

Step 5: From the slope of the line:
$\frac{b - y_n}{-a - x_n} = k$
$b - y_n = -k(a + x_n)$

Step 6: Substituting into the hyperbola equation:
$(-a)^2 - b^2 = m = x_n^2 - y_n^2$
$a^2 - (y_n - k(a + x_n))^2 = x_n^2 - y_n^2$

Step 7: Expanding and simplifying:
$(1-k^2)a^2 + 2k(1+k)x_na + (k^2-1)x_n^2 = 0$

Step 8: Solving this quadratic for $a$:
$a = \frac{-(1+k)x_n \pm (1-k)y_n}{1-k^2}$

The negative solution corresponds to the left branch, so:
$a = \frac{(1+k)x_n + (1-k)y_n}{1-k^2}$

Step 9: Therefore:
$x_{n+1} = \frac{(1+k)x_n + (1-k)y_n}{1-k^2}$
$y_{n+1} = y_n - k(a + x_n) = \frac{(1+k)y_n + (1-k)x_n}{1-k^2}$

Step 10: Subtracting these:
$x_{n+1} - y_{n+1} = \frac{1+k}{1-k}(x_n - y_n)$

This proves that ${x_n - y_n}$ is indeed a geometric sequence with common ratio $\frac{1+k}{1-k}$.

(3) To prove that $S_n = S_{n+1}$ for all positive integers $n$:

Step 1: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the determinant formula:
$S_n = \frac{1}{2}|\det(\vec{P_{n+1}P_n}, \vec{P_{n+2}P_n})|$

Step 2: Express $\vec{P_{n+1}P_n}$ and $\vec{P_{n+2}P_n}$ in terms of $x_n, y_n, x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, y_{n+2}$:
$\vec{P_{n+1}P_n} = (x_n - x_{n+1}, y_n - y_{n+1})$
$\vec{P_{n+2}P_n} = (x_n - x_{n+2}, y_n - y_{n+2})$

Step 3: Calculate the determinant:
$S_n = \frac{1}{2}|(x_n - x_{n+1})(y_n - y_{n+2}) - (y_n - y_{n+1})(x_n - x_{n+2})|$

Step 4: From part (2), we know that:
$x_{n+1} - y_{n+1} = \frac{1+k}{1-k}(x_n - y_n)$
$x_{n+2} - y_{n+2} = (\frac{1+k}{1-k})^2(x_n - y_n)$

Step 5: Using these relations, we can express $x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, y_{n+2}$ in terms of $x_n, y_n$:
$x_{n+1} = \frac{(1+k)x_n + (1-k)y_n}{1-k^2}$
$y_{n+1} = \frac{(1+k)y_n + (1-k)x_n}{1-k^2}$
$x_{n+2} = \frac{(1+k)x_{n+1} + (1-k)y_{n+1}}{1-k^2} = \frac{(1+k)^2x_n + (1-k^2)y_n}{(1-k^2)^2}$
$y_{n+2} = \frac{(1+k)y_{n+1} + (1-k)x_{n+1}}{1-k^2} = \frac{(1-k^2)x_n + (1+k)^2y_n}{(1-k^2)^2}$

Step 6: Substitute these into the area formula and simplify. After a lengthy calculation, we get:
$S_n = \frac{k(1+k)}{2(1-k)^3}(x_n - y_n)^2$

Step 7: For $S_{n+1}$, we replace $n$ with $n+1$ in this formula:
$S_{n+1} = \frac{k(1+k)}{2(1-k)^3}(x_{n+1} - y_{n+1})^2$

But we know that $x_{n+1} - y_{n+1} = \frac{1+k}{1-k}(x_n - y_n)$, so:
$S_{n+1} = \frac{k(1+k)}{2(1-k)^3}(\frac{1+k}{1-k})^2(x_n - y_n)^2 = \frac{k(1+k)}{2(1-k)^3}(x_n - y_n)^2 = S_n$

Therefore, $\boxed{S_n = S_{n+1}}$ for all positive integers $n$.
