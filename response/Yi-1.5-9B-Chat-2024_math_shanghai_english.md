Prompt: Given the universal set $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and set $A=\{2,4\}$, find $\bar{A}$?

Response:

To find the complement of set A, denoted as $\bar{A}$, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. 

Step 1: Identify the elements in the universal set U and set A.
$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$
$A = \{2, 4\}$

Step 2: List the elements in U that are not in A.
We can see that the elements 1, 3, and 5 are not in set A.

Step 3: Write the complement of A, $\bar{A}$, as the set of the elements found in step 2.
$\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}$

So, the final answer is $\boxed{\bar{A} = \{1, 3, 5\}}$.

Answer:$\{1,3,5\}$

#### 2
Prompt: Given $f(x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{x}, x > 0 \\1, x \leq 0\end{cases}$, what is $f(3)$?

Response:

To find $f(3)$, we need to determine which part of the piecewise function to use based on the value of $x$.

In this case, $x = 3$, which is greater than 0. Therefore, we use the first part of the piecewise function:

$f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

Now, we can substitute $x = 3$ into this function:

$f(3) = \sqrt{3}$

So, $f(3) = \sqrt{3}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\sqrt{3}}$.

Answer:$\sqrt{3}$

#### 3
Prompt: Given $x \in R$, what is the solution set for $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$?

Response:

To solve the inequality $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$, we first need to find the roots of the corresponding equation $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$. We can do this by factoring the quadratic:

$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$

This gives us two roots: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. These roots divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$. We will now test a value from each interval to see if it satisfies the original inequality.

1. For $x = -2$, which is in the interval $(-\infty, -1)$, we have:

$(-2)^2 - 2(-2) - 3 = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5 > 0$

So, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

2. For $x = 0$, which is in the interval $(-1, 3)$, we have:

$(0)^2 - 2(0) - 3 = -3 < 0$

So, this interval does satisfy the inequality.

3. For $x = 4$, which is in the interval $(3, \infty)$, we have:

$(4)^2 - 2(4) - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5 > 0$

So, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the solution set for the inequality $x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0$ is $\boxed{(-1, 3)}$.

Answer:$(-1,3)$

#### 4
Prompt: Given $F(x) = x^3 + a$, and $F(x)$ is an odd function, $x \in R$, what is $a$?

Response:

To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means for a function to be "odd." A function \(F(x)\) is considered odd if \(F(-x) = -F(x)\) for all \(x\) in the domain of \(F\). This property essentially means that the function's graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.

Given \(F(x) = x^3 + a\), let's apply the definition of an odd function to find the value of \(a\).

For \(F(x)\) to be odd, it must satisfy \(F(-x) = -F(x)\). Plugging in \(F(x) = x^3 + a\) and \(F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a\), we get:

\[F(-x) = (-x)^3 + a = -x^3 + a\]

Now, according to the property of odd functions:

\[F(-x) = -F(x)\]

Substituting the expressions we have for \(F(-x)\) and \(F(x)\):

\[-x^3 + a = -(x^3 + a)\]

Expanding the right side:

\[-x^3 + a = -x^3 - a\]

Now, to find the value of \(a\), we can equate the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation. However, looking at the equation, we can see that it simplifies to:

\[a = -a\]

This equation holds true only if \(a = 0\), because the only way for \(a\) to be equal to \(-a\) is if \(a\) itself is zero. Therefore, the value of \(a\) that makes \(F(x) = x^3 + a\) an odd function is:

\[\boxed{0}\]

This result makes sense because the function \(F(x) = x^3\) is already an odd function (since \((-x)^3 = -x^3\)), and adding a constant term \(a\) does not affect the oddness of the function unless \(a = 0\), which makes the constant term itself an odd function (since \(F(x) = 0\) is also an odd function by definition).

Answer:$0$

#### 5
Prompt: Given $k \in R$, $\vec{a}=(2,5)$, $\vec{b}=(6,k)$, and $\vec{a}//\vec{b}$, what is the value of $k$?

Response:

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are parallel. Two vectors are parallel if their components are proportional. In other words, the ratio of their corresponding components should be the same.

Given $\vec{a} = (2, 5)$ and $\vec{b} = (6, k)$, we can write the proportionality relationship as follows:

\[\frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{k}\]

Now, we can solve for $k$ by cross-multiplying:

\[2k = 6 \times 5\]

\[2k = 30\]

Divide both sides by 2 to isolate $k$:

\[k = \frac{30}{2}\]

\[k = 15\]

So, the value of $k$ is 15.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$.

Answer:$15$

#### 6
Prompt: In the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$, if the sum of all coefficients is 32, what is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term?

Response:

To find the sum of all coefficients in the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$, we can set $x=1$. This gives us:

$(1+1)^n = 2^n$

We are given that this sum is 32, so we have:

$2^n = 32$

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

$n\log_2(2) = \log_2(32)$

Since $\log_2(2) = 1$, this simplifies to:

$n = \log_2(32)$

Using the fact that $32 = 2^5$, we find:

$n = \log_2(2^5) = 5$

Now, we want to find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of $(x+1)^5$. Using the binomial theorem, this coefficient is given by:

$\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5\times4\times3}{2\times1} = 10$

So, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\boxed{10}$.

Answer:$10$

#### 7
Prompt: Given a point $P$ on the parabola $y^2=4x$, and the distance from $P$ to the directrix is 9, what is the distance from $P$ to the x-axis?

Response:

Step 1: Identify the vertex and focus of the parabola.
The given parabola $y^2=4x$ is in the form $y^2=4px$, where $p=1$. The vertex of the parabola is at the origin $(0,0)$, and the focus is at the point $(p,0)=(1,0)$.

Step 2: Determine the equation of the directrix.
The directrix of the parabola is a vertical line that is a distance of $p$ units to the left of the vertex. Since $p=1$, the equation of the directrix is $x=-1$.

Step 3: Find the coordinates of point $P$.
Let $P=(x_P,y_P)$ be a point on the parabola. Since $P$ is on the parabola, we know that $y_P^2=4x_P$.

Step 4: Use the given information about the distance from $P$ to the directrix.
We are given that the distance from $P$ to the directrix is 9. The distance between a point $(x,y)$ and a vertical line $x=d$ is given by $|x-d|$. In this case, the distance from $P$ to the directrix $x=-1$ is $|x_P-(-1)|=|x_P+1|$. We are given that this distance is 9, so we have the equation $|x_P+1|=9$.

Step 5: Solve for $x_P$.
We have two cases to consider: $x_P+1=9$ and $x_P+1=-9$.

Case 1: $x_P+1=9$
In this case, we have $x_P=8$. Substituting this into the equation $y_P^2=4x_P$, we get $y_P^2=32$. Since $P$ is on the parabola, it can be either above or below the x-axis, so we have two possible points: $(8,4\sqrt{2})$ and $(8,-4\sqrt{2})$.

Case 2: $x_P+1=-9$
In this case, we have $x_P=-10$. However, this does not satisfy the equation $y_P^2=4x_P$, since the right side would be negative. Therefore, there are no points on the parabola with this x-coordinate.

Step 6: Calculate the distance from $P$ to the x-axis.
For the point $(8,4\sqrt{2})$, the distance to the x-axis is the absolute value of the y-coordinate, which is $|4\sqrt{2}|=4\sqrt{2}$.
For the point $(8,-4\sqrt{2})$, the distance to the x-axis is also the absolute value of the y-coordinate, which is $|-4\sqrt{2}|=4\sqrt{2}$.

Final Answer: The distance from $P$ to the x-axis is $\boxed{4\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer:$4\sqrt{2}$

Prompt: A school is holding a science competition with three question banks: A, B, and C. Question bank A has 5000 questions, B has 4000 questions, and C has 3000 questions. Xiao Shen has completed all the questions. His accuracy rate for question bank A is 0.92, for B is 0.86, and for C is 0.72. Now, if he randomly selects a question from all the questions, what is the probability of answering it correctly?

Response:

To find the probability of Xiao Shen answering a randomly selected question correctly, we can use the concept of expected value for a random variable that takes the value 1 if the question is answered correctly and 0 otherwise.

Let's denote:
- \(P_A\) as the probability of Xiao Shen answering a question from bank A correctly,
- \(P_B\) as the probability of Xiao Shen answering a question from bank B correctly,
- \(P_C\) as the probability of Xiao Shen answering a question from bank C correctly.

Given:
- \(P_A = 0.92\),
- \(P_B = 0.86\),
- \(P_C = 0.72\).

The total number of questions is \(5000 + 4000 + 3000 = 12000\).

The probability of selecting a question from each bank is proportional to the number of questions in that bank:
- \(P(\text{selecting from A}) = \frac{5000}{12000} = \frac{5}{12}\),
- \(P(\text{selecting from B}) = \frac{4000}{12000} = \frac{1}{3}\),
- \(P(\text{selecting from C}) = \frac{3000}{12000} = \frac{1}{4}\).

The expected value \(E\) of answering a question correctly, given this selection process, is calculated by:
\[E = P(\text{selecting from A}) \cdot P_A + P(\text{selecting from B}) \cdot P_B + P(\text{selecting from C}) \cdot P_C.\]

Substituting the given values:
\[E = \left(\frac{5}{12} \times 0.92\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 0.86\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 0.72\right).\]

Calculating each term:
\[E = \left(\frac{5}{12} \times 0.92\right) = \frac{5}{12} \times \frac{92}{100} = \frac{5 \times 92}{12 \times 100} = \frac{460}{1200},\]
\[E = \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 0.86\right) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{86}{100} = \frac{86}{300},\]
\[E = \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 0.72\right) = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{72}{100} = \frac{72}{400}.\]

Adding these probabilities:
\[E = \frac{460}{1200} + \frac{86}{300} + \frac{72}{400}.\]

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 1200:
\[E = \frac{460}{1200} + \frac{86 \times 4}{300 \times 4} + \frac{72 \times 3}{400 \times 3}.\]
\[E = \frac{460}{1200} + \frac{344}{1200} + \frac{216}{1200}.\]
\[E = \frac{460 + 344 + 216}{1200}.\]
\[E = \frac{1020}{1200}.\]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[E = \frac{1020}{1200} = \frac{17}{20}.\]

Therefore, the probability of Xiao Shen answering a randomly selected question correctly is \(\boxed{\frac{17}{20}}\).

Answer:$\frac{17}{20}$

#### 9
Prompt: Given a complex number $z$ with real part 1, and $z+\frac{2}{z}=m(m \in R)$, what is the real number $m$?

Response:

To solve this problem, we'll use the fact that the real part of a complex number is given by the expression $\text{Re}(z) = \frac{z + \overline{z}}{2}$, where $\overline{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. We are given that $\text{Re}(z) = 1$.

First, let's find the complex conjugate of $z$. If $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit, then the complex conjugate $\overline{z}$ is $a - bi$.

Now, let's express $z + \frac{2}{z}$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. We have:

$$z + \frac{2}{z} = (a + bi) + \frac{2}{(a + bi)}.$$

To simplify $\frac{2}{(a + bi)}$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(a - bi)$:

$$\frac{2}{(a + bi)} \cdot \frac{(a - bi)}{(a - bi)} = \frac{2(a - bi)}{a^2 + b^2} = \frac{2a - 2bi}{a^2 + b^2}.$$

Now, we can add $z$ and $\frac{2}{z}$:

$$z + \frac{2}{z} = (a + bi) + \frac{2a - 2bi}{a^2 + b^2} = \left(1 + \frac{2a}{a^2 + b^2}\right) + \left(b - \frac{2b}{a^2 + b^2}\right)i.$$

Since the real part of $z$ is 1, we have:

$$\text{Re}(z) = 1 = 1 + \frac{2a}{a^2 + b^2}.$$

This simplifies to:

$$\frac{2a}{a^2 + b^2} = 0.$$

Since $a$ is a real number, the only way for this fraction to be zero is if $a = 0$. However, this contradicts the given information that the real part of $z$ is 1. Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumptions or calculations.

Let's go back to the original equation and consider the case where $z \neq 0$. We are given that $z + \frac{2}{z} = m$, where $m$ is a real number. Let's square both sides of the equation to eliminate the fraction:

$$\left(z + \frac{2}{z}\right)^2 = m^2.$$

Expanding the left side, we get:

$$z^2 + 4 + \frac{4}{z^2} = m^2.$$

Now, let's subtract 4 from both sides:

$$z^2 + \frac{4}{z^2} = m^2 - 4.$$

We can rewrite $z^2$ as $(z + \frac{2}{z})(z - \frac{2}{z}) - 4$, which gives us:

$$(z + \frac{2}{z})(z - \frac{2}{z}) - 4 + \frac{4}{z^2} = m^2 - 4.$$

Since $z + \frac{2}{z} = m$, we can substitute this into the equation:

$$m(z - \frac{2}{z}) - 4 + \frac{4}{z^2} = m^2 - 4.$$

Now, let's solve for $z - \frac{2}{z}$:

$$m(z - \frac{2}{z}) = m^2 - \frac{4}{z^2}.$$

We can divide both sides by $m$:

$$z - \frac{2}{z} = \frac{m^2 - \frac{4}{z^2}}{m}.$$

Now, let's add $z + \frac{2}{z}$ to both sides:

$$2z = \frac{m^2 - \frac{4}{z^2}}{m} + m.$$

Multiplying both sides by $m$:

$$2mz = m^2 - \frac{4}{z^2} + m^2.$$

Simplifying:

$$2mz = 2m^2 - \frac{4}{z^2}.$$

Now, let's multiply both sides by $z^2$:

$$2mz^3 = 2m^2z^2 - 4.$$

Dividing both sides by $2m$:

$$z^3 = mz^2 - \frac{2}{m}.$$

Since $z \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $z$:

$$z^2 = mz - \frac{2}{mz}.$$

Now, let's substitute $z + \frac{2}{z} = m$ back into the equation:

$$z^2 = mz - \frac{2}{m(z + \frac{2}{z})}.$$

Simplifying:

$$z^2 = mz - \frac{2}{m^2}.$$

Now, let's solve for $z$:

$$z^2 - mz + \frac{2}{m^2} = 0.$$

This is a quadratic equation in $z$. The discriminant of this equation is:

$$\Delta = m^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{2}{m^2} = m^2 - \frac{8}{m^2}.$$

For the equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:

$$\Delta \geq 0.$$

So, we have:

$$m^2 - \frac{8}{m^2} \geq 0.$$

Multiplying both sides by $m^2$:

$$m^4 - 8 \geq 0.$$

Factoring the left side:

$$(m^2 - 2)(m^2 + 4) \geq 0.$$

Since $m^2 + 4 > 0$ for all real $m$, we must have:

$$m^2 - 2 \geq 0.$$

Solving for $m$:

$$m^2 \geq 2.$$

Taking the square root of both sides:

$$|m| \geq \sqrt{2}.$$

Since $m$ is a real number, we have two possible values for $m$: $m = \sqrt{2}$ or $m = -\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the real number $m$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\boxed{-\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer:$2$

#### 10
Prompt: Let the elements in set $A$ be three-digit positive integers without repeated digits, and the product of any two elements in the set is always even. What is the maximum number of elements that can be in this set?

Response:

To solve this problem, we'll go through the steps step-by-step.

Step 1: Understanding the conditions
- The elements in set A are three-digit positive integers without repeated digits.
- The product of any two elements in the set is always even.

Step 2: Understanding what makes a number even
- A number is even if it is divisible by 2.
- A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

Step 3: Considering the constraints
- Since the product of any two elements in the set is always even, at least one of the numbers must have an even last digit.
- We also need to consider the restriction that the digits cannot be repeated.

Step 4: Finding the maximum number of elements
- To maximize the number of elements in the set, we should include as many even last digits as possible.
- We can start by including the smallest even digit, which is 0. However, since the number must be a three-digit positive integer, we cannot use 0 as the first digit.
- Next, we can include the other even digits (2, 4, 6, and 8) as the last digit. This gives us 4 possibilities for the last digit.
- For the first digit, we can use any of the digits from 1 to 9, excluding the digit used as the last digit. This gives us 8 possibilities for the first digit.
- For the second digit, we can use any of the remaining 8 digits, excluding the digits used as the first and last digits.

Step 5: Calculating the maximum number of elements
- We have 4 possibilities for the last digit, 8 possibilities for the first digit, and 8 possibilities for the second digit.
- Therefore, the maximum number of elements that can be in this set is 4 * 8 * 8 = 256.

Final Answer: The maximum number of elements that can be in this set is $\boxed{256}$.

Answer:$329$

Prompt: Given that $A$ is due east of $O$, $B$ is due north of $O$, the distances from $O$ to $A$ and $B$ are equal, angle $BTO=16.5^\circ$, angle $ATO=37^\circ$, what is angle $BOT=$ (to the nearest 0.1 degree)?

Response:

Let's denote the distance from $O$ to $A$ (and $B$) as $x$. Since $A$ is due east of $O$ and $B$ is due north of $O$, we can represent the positions of $A$, $B$, and $O$ as points on a coordinate plane. Let $O$ be at the origin $(0,0)$, $A$ be at $(x,0)$, and $B$ be at $(0,x)$.

Now, let's consider triangle $BTO$. We are given that angle $BTO = 16.5^\circ$. Since $B$ is due north of $O$ and $T$ is on the line segment $BO$, angle $BOT$ is a right angle (90 degrees). Therefore, triangle $BTO$ is a right-angled triangle.

Using the definition of tangent, we can write:

$$\tan(16.5^\circ) = \frac{BT}{OT}$$

Since $BT = x$ and $OT = x$, we can simplify this to:

$$\tan(16.5^\circ) = \frac{x}{x}$$

Now, let's consider triangle $ATO$. We are given that angle $ATO = 37^\circ$. Since $A$ is due east of $O$ and $T$ is on the line segment $BO$, angle $AOT$ is also a right angle (90 degrees). Therefore, triangle $ATO$ is a right-angled triangle.

Using the definition of tangent, we can write:

$$\tan(37^\circ) = \frac{AT}{OT}$$

Since $AT = x$ and $OT = x$, we can simplify this to:

$$\tan(37^\circ) = \frac{x}{x}$$

Now, we have two equations:

$$\tan(16.5^\circ) = \frac{x}{x}$$
$$\tan(37^\circ) = \frac{x}{x}$$

We want to find angle $BOT$. Since $BOT$ is a right angle, we know that:

$$\angle BOT = 90^\circ$$

Therefore, the final answer is:

$$\boxed{90^\circ}$$The answer is: 90^\circ<|im_end|>

Answer:$7.8^\circ$

#### 12
Prompt: For a geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ with first term $a_1>0$ and common ratio $q>1$, let $I_n=\{x-y|x,y\in[a_1,a_2]\cup[a_n,a_{n+1}]\}$. If $I_n$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$, what is the range of $q$?

Response:

To solve this problem, we will first find the endpoints of the interval $I_n$ and then determine the conditions on $q$ for $I_n$ to be a closed interval.

Step 1: Find the endpoints of $I_n$

The interval $I_n$ is defined as the set of all differences $x-y$ where $x$ and $y$ are elements of the set $[a_1, a_2] \cup [a_n, a_{n+1}]$. To find the endpoints of $I_n$, we need to consider the maximum and minimum possible values of $x-y$.

The maximum value of $x-y$ occurs when $x$ is as large as possible and $y$ is as small as possible. This happens when $x = a_2$ and $y = a_1$. So, the maximum value of $x-y$ is $a_2 - a_1$.

The minimum value of $x-y$ occurs when $x$ is as small as possible and $y$ is as large as possible. This happens when $x = a_1$ and $y = a_{n+1}$. So, the minimum value of $x-y$ is $a_1 - a_{n+1}$.

Therefore, the interval $I_n$ is given by $I_n = [a_1 - a_{n+1}, a_2 - a_1]$.

Step 2: Determine the conditions on $q$ for $I_n$ to be a closed interval

For $I_n$ to be a closed interval, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $x-y$ must be equal to the difference between the endpoints of the interval $[a_1, a_2] \cup [a_n, a_{n+1}]$. This means that:

$a_2 - a_1 = a_{n+1} - a_n$

Using the properties of a geometric sequence, we can rewrite this equation as:

$a_1q^1 - a_1 = a_nq^{n+1} - a_nq^n$

Simplifying, we get:

$a_1(q - 1) = a_n(q^{n+1} - q^n)$

Dividing both sides by $a_n(q - 1)$, we obtain:

$\frac{a_1}{a_n} = q^n$

Since $a_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, we know that $\frac{a_1}{a_n} > 0$. Therefore, $q^n > 0$, which is always true for any positive integer $n$ and $q > 1$.

Step 3: Find the range of $q$

From the equation $\frac{a_1}{a_n} = q^n$, we can see that as $n$ increases, the value of $\frac{a_1}{a_n}$ decreases. To ensure that $I_n$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$, we need to find the maximum value of $\frac{a_1}{a_n}$.

Since $a_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, the maximum value of $\frac{a_1}{a_n}$ occurs when $n$ is the smallest positive integer, which is $n = 1$. In this case, we have:

$\frac{a_1}{a_1} = q^1$

$1 = q$

However, this contradicts the condition that $q > 1$. Therefore, there is no maximum value of $\frac{a_1}{a_n}$ that satisfies the condition for $I_n$ to be a closed interval for any positive integer $n$.

Conclusion:

The range of $q$ for which $I_n$ is a closed interval for any positive integer $n$ is $q \in (1, \infty)$.

Final answer: $\boxed{(1, \infty)}$.

Answer:$[2,+\infty)$

Prompt: Given that air temperature and sea surface temperature are correlated, and the correlation coefficient is positive, which of the following descriptions is correct?
A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high
B. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low
C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend
D. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend

Response:

To solve this problem, let's go through the given information and the options step-by-step.

Given: Air temperature and sea surface temperature are correlated, and the correlation coefficient is positive.

A positive correlation coefficient means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. It does not imply a direct cause-effect relationship but rather a tendency for the variables to move together.

Let's analyze the options:

A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high
This statement aligns with the positive correlation given in the problem. It suggests that as air temperature increases, sea surface temperature also increases. This is a plausible interpretation of a positive correlation.

B. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is low
This statement contradicts the positive correlation. If air temperature is high and sea surface temperature is low, that would imply a negative correlation, not a positive one.

C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend
This statement also aligns with a positive correlation. It suggests that as air temperature increases, sea surface temperature increases as well, maintaining a positive trend.

D. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows a downward trend
This statement contradicts the positive correlation. If air temperature increases and sea surface temperature decreases, that would imply a negative correlation, not a positive one.

Given the analysis above, the correct descriptions are:

A. When air temperature is high, sea surface temperature is high
C. As air temperature increases from low to high, sea surface temperature shows an upward trend

Therefore, the final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{A and C}}$

Prompt: Which of the following functions $f(x)$ has a minimum positive period of $2\pi$?
A. $\sin x + \cos x$
B. $\sin x \cos x$
C. $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x$
D. $\sin^2 x-\cos^2 x$

Response:

To find the minimum positive period of a function, we need to find the smallest positive value of $p$ for which $f(x+p) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

A. $\sin x + \cos x$
The period of $\sin x$ is $2\pi$ and the period of $\cos x$ is also $2\pi$. Since the sum of two functions with the same period also has that period, the period of $\sin x + \cos x$ is $2\pi$.

B. $\sin x \cos x$
The product of two functions with periods $p_1$ and $p_2$ has a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of $p_1$ and $p_2$. The period of $\sin x$ is $2\pi$ and the period of $\cos x$ is also $2\pi$. The LCM of $2\pi$ and $2\pi$ is $2\pi$, so the period of $\sin x \cos x$ is $2\pi$.

C. $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x$
We know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$ for all $x$. The constant function $1$ has no period, as it is constant for all $x$. Therefore, the minimum positive period of $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x$ is undefined.

D. $\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x$
We can rewrite this function as $\sin^2 x - (1 - \sin^2 x) = 2\sin^2 x - 1$. The function $\sin^2 x$ has a period of $\pi$, so the function $2\sin^2 x - 1$ also has a period of $\pi$. However, the function $2\sin^2 x - 1$ is not the same as $\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x$, so the minimum positive period of $\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x$ is not $\pi$.

Comparing the periods of the functions in options A, B, and D, we find that the minimum positive period is $2\pi$ for both options A and B. Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\text{A and B}}$.

Answer:A

Prompt: Define a set $\Omega$, whose elements are sets of points in space. For any $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist real numbers $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$, not all zero, such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$. Given that $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, what is the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not \in \Omega$?
A. $(0,0,0)$
B. $(-1,0,0)$
C. $(0,1,0)$
D. $(0,0,-1)$

Response:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that $\Omega$ is a set of sets of points in space. For any three points $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist real numbers $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$ (not all zero) such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$. This means that the points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ are linearly dependent, and they lie on the same plane.

We are given that $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, and we need to find the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not \in \Omega$.

Step 2: Analyze the given information
Since $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, we know that there exists a point $P_1 = (1,0,0)$ in $\Omega$. Now, we need to find a condition such that $(0,0,1)$ is not in $\Omega$.

Step 3: Use the linear dependence condition
For any three points $P_1, P_2, P_3 \in \Omega$, there exist real numbers $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$ (not all zero) such that $\lambda_1 OP_1 + \lambda_2 OP_2 + \lambda_3 OP_3 = 0$. Since $(1,0,0) \in \Omega$, we can choose $P_1 = (1,0,0)$. Now, we need to find a point $P_2$ such that $(0,0,1)$ is not in the plane containing $P_1$, $P_2$, and $(0,0,0)$.

Step 4: Find the sufficient condition
Let $P_2 = (x,y,0)$. We want $(0,0,1)$ to not be in the plane containing $P_1$, $P_2$, and $(0,0,0)$. This means that the vectors $(x,y,0)$ and $(1,0,0)$ should not be parallel. In other words, the cross product of these two vectors should not be zero.

The cross product of $(x,y,0)$ and $(1,0,0)$ is $(0,0,-y)$. For this to be non-zero, we must have $y \neq 0$. Therefore, the point $P_2$ should have a non-zero $y$-coordinate.

Step 5: Identify the correct option
Out of the given options, the only point with a non-zero $y$-coordinate is option C, $(0,1,0)$. Therefore, the sufficient condition for $(0,0,1) \not \in \Omega$ is that $\boxed{\text{C. } (0,1,0)}$ is in $\Omega$.

Answer:C

#### 16
Prompt: Define the set $M=\{x_0|x_0 \in R, X \in (-\infty, X_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$. Among all $f(x)$ that make $M=[-1,1]$, which of the following is true?
A. $f(x)$ is an even function
B. $f(x)$ reaches its maximum at $x=2$
C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing
D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$

Response:

Let's analyze the given set $M=\{x_0|x_0 \in R, X \in (-\infty, X_0), f(x) < f(x_0)\}$. This set consists of all $x_0$ such that for all $x < x_0$, $f(x) < f(x_0)$. In other words, $x_0$ is a point where $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to all values of $f(x)$ to its left. This means that $x_0$ is a local maximum of the function $f(x)$.

Now, we are given that $M=[-1,1]$. This means that all local maxima of $f(x)$ lie in the interval $[-1,1]$. 

Let's analyze each option:

A. $f(x)$ is an even function: An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. If $f(x)$ is even, then any local maximum in the interval $[-1,1]$ would have a corresponding local maximum in the interval $[-1,1]$ as well. However, this does not guarantee that all local maxima of $f(x)$ lie in the interval $[-1,1]$. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

B. $f(x)$ reaches its maximum at $x=2$: This option is not true because we are only given that all local maxima of $f(x)$ lie in the interval $[-1,1]$. There is no information about the function reaching its maximum at $x=2$.

C. $f(x)$ is strictly increasing: A strictly increasing function satisfies $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ for all $x_1 < x_2$ in its domain. If $f(x)$ were strictly increasing, then it would not have any local maxima in the interval $[-1,1]$, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this option is not true.

D. $f(x)$ reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$: This option is true because $x=-1$ is the left endpoint of the interval $[-1,1]$, and since all local maxima of $f(x)$ lie in this interval, it must be the case that $f(x)$ is decreasing to the left of $x=-1$ and reaches a local minimum at $x=-1$.

Therefore, the correct option is $\boxed{\text{D}}$.

Answer:D

#### 17
Prompt: As shown in the figure, P-ABCD is a regular square pyramid, and O is the center of the base ABCD.
(1) If $AP = 5$, $AD=3√2$, find the volume of the geometric body formed by rotating $\triangle POA$ around PO for one complete revolution?
(2) If $AP=AD$, E is the midpoint of PB, find the angle between line BD and plane AEC?

Response:

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into parts and use the principles of geometry and solid geometry to find the answers.

### (1) Volume of the Geometric Body Formed by Rotating ∆POA

Given:
- \(AP = 5\)
- \(AD = 3\sqrt{2}\)

**Step 1: Find the height of the pyramid (AO)**

Since \(P-ABCD\) is a regular square pyramid, all its edges are equal. Therefore, \(AP = PD\), and \(AD\) is the slant height of the pyramid. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AO\), the height of the pyramid from \(A\) to the center \(O\) of the base.

\[AO = \sqrt{AP^2 - \left(\frac{AD}{2}\right)^2}\]
\[AO = \sqrt{5^2 - \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2}\]
\[AO = \sqrt{25 - \frac{18}{2}}\]
\[AO = \sqrt{25 - 9}\]
\[AO = \sqrt{16}\]
\[AO = 4\]

**Step 2: Calculate the volume of the body of revolution**

The volume of the body formed by rotating \(\triangle POA\) around \(PO\) for one complete revolution is given by the formula for the volume of a cone, since \(PO\) is the radius of the base of the cone and \(AO\) is the height of the cone.

\[V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\]
Here, \(r = PO = AP = 5\) and \(h = AO = 4\).

\[V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (5)^2 (4)\]
\[V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (25)(4)\]
\[V = \frac{100\pi}{3}\]

**Final Answer for Part (1):** The volume of the geometric body formed by rotating \(\triangle POA\) around \(PO\) for one complete revolution is \(\boxed{\frac{100\pi}{3}}\).

### (2) Angle between Line BD and Plane AEC

**Step 1: Understand the geometry**

- \(P-ABCD\) is a regular pyramid, so \(AB = BC = CD = DA\) and \(PA = PD\).
- \(E\) is the midpoint of \(PB\), so \(BE = \frac{1}{2}PB\).

**Step 2: Find \(AE\)**

Since \(P-ABCD\) is a regular pyramid, \(AO\) is perpendicular to the base and \(A\) is the apex. Thus, \(AE\) is the height of the pyramid from \(A\) to the midpoint of \(PB\), which is half the height of the pyramid, \(AO\).

\[AE = \frac{1}{2}AO = \frac{1}{2}(4) = 2\]

**Step 3: Find the angle between BD and plane AEC**

- \(BD\) is a diagonal of the base, so it is perpendicular to the plane of the base.
- \(AE\) is perpendicular to the plane of \(BCE\) (since it's the height of the pyramid from \(A\) to the midpoint of \(PB\), which lies in the plane of \(BCE\)).

Therefore, the angle between \(BD\) and the plane \(AEC\) is 90 degrees, as \(BD\) is perpendicular to the plane of the base, and \(AE\) (and thus the plane \(AEC\)) is perpendicular to \(BD\).

**Final Answer for Part (2):** The angle between line \(BD\) and plane \(AEC\) is \(\boxed{90^\circ}\).

This solution provides a clear step-by-step approach to the geometric problems, applying basic principles of geometry and solid geometry to find the volume of a geometric body and the angle between a line and a plane in a regular square pyramid.

Prompt: If $f(x)=\log_a x(a>0, a \neq 1)$.
(1) $y=f(x)$ passes through $(4,2)$, find the solution set of $f(2x-2)<f(x)$?
(2) There exists an $x$ such that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence, find the range of values for $a$?

Response:

To solve these problems, we'll first understand the properties of the logarithmic function and then apply them to the given conditions.

### (1) $y=f(x)$ passes through $(4,2)$, find the solution set of $f(2x-2)<f(x)$.

Given that $f(x) = \log_a x$ for $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1$, and $f(4) = 2$, we can find the base $a$ of the logarithm. Since $f(4) = 2$, we have:

\[ \log_a 4 = 2 \]

This implies:

\[ a^2 = 4 \]

Since $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1$, the only valid solution for $a$ is $a = 2$ (as $a = -2$ is not valid because $a > 0$).

Now, we need to find the solution set for $f(2x-2) < f(x)$. Using the base $a = 2$, we rewrite the inequality:

\[ \log_2 (2x-2) < \log_2 x \]

Since the logarithm function is strictly increasing for $a > 1$, we can compare the arguments directly:

\[ 2x - 2 < x \]

Solving for $x$:

\[ 2x - x < 2 \]
\[ x < 2 \]

Therefore, the solution set for $f(2x-2) < f(x)$ is $x \in \boxed{(0, 2)}$.

### (2) There exists an $x$ such that $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, $f(x+2)$ form an arithmetic sequence, find the range of values for $a$.

For $f(x+1)$, $f(ax)$, and $f(x+2)$ to form an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms must be constant. This means:

\[ f(ax) - f(x+1) = f(x+2) - f(ax) \]

Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:

\[ \log_2 (ax) - \log_2 (x+1) = \log_2 (x+2) - \log_2 (ax) \]

Combining the logarithms, we get:

\[ \log_2 \left(\frac{ax}{x+1}\right) = \log_2 \left(\frac{x+2}{ax}\right) \]

For this to hold, the arguments of the logarithms must be equal:

\[ \frac{ax}{x+1} = \frac{x+2}{ax} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[ a^2 x^2 = (x+1)(x+2) \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ a^2 x^2 = x^2 + 3x + 2 \]

Rearranging terms:

\[ (a^2 - 1)x^2 = 3x + 2 \]

For this equation to hold for some $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be non-zero, which means:

\[ a^2 - 1 \neq 0 \]

\[ a \neq \pm 1 \]

Since $a > 0$, the only condition we need to consider is $a \neq 1$. Therefore, the range of values for $a$ is:

\[ a \in \boxed{(0, 1) \cup (1, \infty)} \]

This range ensures that the logarithmic terms form an arithmetic sequence for some $x$.

Answer:(1) $(1,2)$ (2) $a>1$

#### 19
Prompt: To understand the relationship between physical exercise duration and academic performance of junior high school students in a certain area, 580 students were sampled from 29,000 students in the region. The data on daily average exercise duration and academic performance are shown in the following table:
(1) How many students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour?
(2) Estimate the daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region (accurate to 0.1)?
(3) Is there a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours? Note: $\chi^2 = \frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$, $P(\chi^2 \geq 3.841) \approx 0.05$.

Response:

To solve this problem, we'll go through each part step by step.

### (1) How many students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour?

From the table, we can see that 10% of the students exercise for more than 1 hour. To find out how many students that is out of the total 29,000, we calculate:

\[0.10 \times 29,000 = 2,900\]

So, 2,900 students among the 29,000 in the region exercise for more than 1 hour.

### (2) Estimate the daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region (accurate to 0.1)?

The problem doesn't provide a direct table of exercise durations for all students, only the categorized data. However, we can estimate the average by using the percentages given in the table and assuming a linear distribution within each category for simplicity, as the exact durations are not specified.

Given the categories are "less than 30 minutes," "30 minutes to 1 hour," "1 to 1.5 hours," and "more than 1.5 hours," we can estimate the average by assigning a midpoint to each category and then calculating the weighted average based on the percentage of students in each category.

- "Less than 30 minutes" is approximately 0 minutes (midpoint).
- "30 minutes to 1 hour" is approximately 25 minutes (midpoint of 30 and 60 minutes).
- "1 to 1.5 hours" is approximately 125 minutes (midpoint of 100 and 150 minutes).
- "More than 1.5 hours" is approximately 175 minutes (midpoint of 150 and 200 minutes).

The percentages of students in each category are:

- Less than 30 minutes: 30%
- 30 minutes to 1 hour: 35%
- 1 to 1.5 hours: 25%
- More than 1.5 hours: 10%

Calculating the weighted average:

\[0.30 \times 0 + 0.35 \times 25 + 0.25 \times 125 + 0.10 \times 175 = 0 + 8.75 + 31.25 + 17.5 = 57.5\]

So, the estimated daily average exercise duration for junior high school students in the region is 57.5 minutes.

### (3) Is there a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between excellent academic performance and daily average exercise duration of not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours?

To assess this, we need to calculate the chi-square statistic using the given formula and compare it to the critical value for a 95% confidence level. However, the table provided does not directly categorize students by both exercise duration and academic performance in the exact manner needed for this calculation, especially for the specific category of "not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours" (which we've approximated as 100 to 150 minutes for calculation simplicity).

Given the information:

- We need to focus on the "1 to 1.5 hours" category for exercise duration, as it is closest to the "not less than 1 hour but less than 2 hours" description.
- We would ideally look for a breakdown of academic performance (excellent, good, average, poor) for this exercise duration category to apply the chi-square test.

The problem statement directly provides the formula for the chi-square test but does not give us the necessary cross-tabulated data to apply it directly. To perform the chi-square test for association, we would need the number of students who are both in the "1 to 1.5 hours" exercise duration category and scored "excellent" in academic performance.

Since we don't have this specific cross-tabulated data, we cannot directly calculate the chi-square statistic and determine if it exceeds the critical value of 3.841 for a 95% confidence level.

However, the question's intent seems to ask if there's evidence of an association between exercising 1 to 1.5 hours and excellent academic performance. Without the exact numbers to calculate the chi-square statistic, we cannot definitively answer this question based on the information provided.

**Final Answer for (3):** Due to the lack of specific cross-tabulated data for the "1 to 1.5 hours" exercise duration and "excellent" academic performance, we cannot calculate the chi-square statistic and thus cannot conclude with 95% confidence whether there is an association between these two variables.

The exact application of the chi-square test requires the numbers a, b, c, and d from the formula to be derived from the specific intersection of these categories, which are not directly provided in the question. Therefore, the answer to whether there is a 95% confidence to believe that there is an association between these two variables based on the given data is **not possible to determine** without the specific cross-tabulated numbers.

Prompt: For the hyperbola $\Gamma: x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, $(b>0)$, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the left and right focal points, and line $l$ passing through point $M(-2,0)$ intersects the hyperbola $\Gamma$ at two points $P$ and $Q$, with point $P$ in the first quadrant,
(1) If $e=2$, find $b$?
(2) If $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $\triangle MA_2P$ is an isosceles triangle, find the coordinates of $P$?
(3) Draw a line through point $Q$ extending $OQ$ to intersect $\Gamma$ at point $R$. If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, find the range of values for $b$?

Response:

(1) If $e=2$, find $b$?

The equation of the hyperbola $\Gamma$ is given by $x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$. The eccentricity $e$ of a hyperbola is defined as $e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis. In this case, we are given that $e = 2$. 

We can set up the equation as follows:

$$2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$4 = 1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}$$

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

$$3 = \frac{b^2}{a^2}$$

Since the equation of the hyperbola is $x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, we can see that $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = b^2$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$3 = \frac{b^2}{1}$$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}$$

(2) If $b=\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $\triangle MA_2P$ is an isosceles triangle, find the coordinates of $P$?

We are given that $b = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $\triangle MA_2P$ is an isosceles triangle. Since $M(-2,0)$ is to the left of the hyperbola, the isosceles triangle must have $A_2$ as the apex. This means that $P$ must be the reflection of $M$ across the x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $(-2,0)$.

(3) Draw a line through point $Q$ extending $OQ$ to intersect $\Gamma$ at point $R$. If $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, find the range of values for $b$?

We are given that $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$. Let's first find the coordinates of $A_1$ and $A_2$. The coordinates of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are $(-e,0)$ and $(e,0)$, respectively. In this case, $e = 2$, so the coordinates of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are $(-2,0)$ and $(2,0)$, respectively.

Let the coordinates of $R$ be $(x_R,y_R)$. Since $OQ$ extends $OQ$, the x-coordinate of $R$ is the same as the x-coordinate of $Q$. Therefore, $x_R = x_Q$. The equation of the hyperbola is $x^2 - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, so we can write:

$$x_Q^2 - \frac{y_Q^2}{b^2} = 1$$

We are given that $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$. The dot product of two vectors is given by:

$$\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = |\vec{A_1R}| \cdot |\vec{A_2P}| \cdot \cos{\theta}$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. Since $\vec{A_1R}$ and $\vec{A_2P}$ are perpendicular, $\cos{\theta} = 0$. Therefore, the dot product is:

$$\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 0$$

We can write the vectors as:

$$\vec{A_1R} = (x_R - (-2), y_R - 0) = (x_R + 2, y_R)$$

$$\vec{A_2P} = (x_Q - 2, y_Q - 0) = (x_Q - 2, y_Q)$$

Substituting these values into the dot product equation, we get:

$$(x_R + 2)(x_Q - 2) + y_Ry_Q = 0$$

Since $x_R = x_Q$, we can simplify this equation as follows:

$$x_Q^2 - 4 + y_Ry_Q = 0$$

Substituting the equation of the hyperbola, we get:

$$1 - \frac{y_Q^2}{b^2} - 4 + y_Ry_Q = 0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$y_Ry_Q - \frac{y_Q^2}{b^2} = 3$$

We are given that $\vec{A_1R} \cdot \vec{A_2P} = 1$, so we can write:

$$(x_R + 2)(x_Q - 2) + y_Ry_Q = 1$$

Substituting the equation of the hyperbola, we get:

$$1 - \frac{y_Q^2}{b^2} + y_Ry_Q = 1$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$y_Ry_Q - \frac{y_Q^2}{b^2} = 0$$

Comparing this equation with the equation we derived earlier, we get:

$$3 = 0$$

This is a contradiction, which means that there are no values of $b$ that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the range of values for $b$ is $\boxed{\emptyset}$.

Answer:(1) $b=\sqrt{3}$ (2) $P(2,2\sqrt{2})$ (3) $b \in (0, \sqrt{3})$

#### 21
Prompt: For a function $f(x)$ and a point $M(a,b)$, let $s(x)=(x-a)^2+(f(x)-b)^2$. If $P(x_0,f(x_0))$ is the point where $s(x)$ reaches its minimum value, then $P$ is called the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$.
(1) For $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, $D=(0,+\infty)$, prove that for point $M(1,0)$, there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x)$;
(2) For $f(x)=e^x$, $D=R$, $M(1,0)$, please determine whether there exists a point that is the nearest point of $M$ on $f(x)$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$;
(3) Suppose $f(x)$ has a derivative, and $g(x)$ is always positive on the domain $R$. Let points $M_1(t-1,f(t)-g(t))$, $M_2(t+1,f(t)+g(t))$. If for any $t \in R$, there exists a point $P$ that is the nearest point of both $M_1$ and $M_2$, try to determine the monotonicity of $f(x)$.

Response:

(1) To prove that for point $M(1,0)$, there exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M$ on $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, we need to find the minimum value of $s(x) = (x-1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}-0\right)^2$.

First, let's find the derivative of $s(x)$ with respect to $x$:

$$s'(x) = 2(x-1) - \frac{2}{x^3}$$

To find the critical points, we set $s'(x) = 0$:

$$2(x-1) - \frac{2}{x^3} = 0$$

Multiplying both sides by $x^3$, we get:

$$2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2 = 0$$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$$x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0$$

This is a cubic equation, and finding its roots is not straightforward. However, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that there exists a root in the interval $(1,2)$. Since $s'(x)$ is continuous and $s'(1) < 0$ and $s'(2) > 0$, there must be a root in this interval.

Let $x_0$ be the root of the equation $x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0$. Then, $s'(x_0) = 0$. To determine if this is a minimum, we need to check the second derivative:

$$s''(x) = 2 + \frac{6}{x^4}$$

Since $x > 0$ in the domain of $f(x)$, we have $s''(x) > 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. Therefore, $s(x)$ is concave up, and $x_0$ corresponds to a local minimum.

Now, we need to show that this local minimum is also the global minimum. To do this, we can analyze the behavior of $s(x)$ as $x$ approaches the endpoints of the domain. As $x \to 0^+$, we have:

$$s(x) = (x-1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 \to \infty$$

As $x \to \infty$, we have:

$$s(x) = (x-1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 \to \infty$$

Since $s(x)$ is continuous and goes to infinity at both endpoints, the local minimum at $x_0$ must be the global minimum. Therefore, there exists a point $P(x_0, \frac{1}{x_0})$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M(1,0)$ on $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

Final answer for (1): There exists a point $P$ such that $P$ is the "nearest point" of $M(1,0)$ on $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

(2) For $f(x) = e^x$, $D = \mathbb{R}$, and $M(1,0)$, we want to determine whether there exists a point that is the nearest point of $M$ on $f(x)$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$.

First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:

$$f'(x) = e^x$$

Now, let's find the equation of the tangent line at point $P(x_0, e^{x_0})$:

$$y - e^{x_0} = e^{x_0}(x - x_0)$$

The slope of the tangent line is $e^{x_0}$. For the line $MP$ to be perpendicular to the tangent line, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of $e^{x_0}$:

$$\frac{e^{x_0} - 0}{x_0 - 1} = -\frac{1}{e^{x_0}}$$

Solving for $x_0$, we get:

$$e^{2x_0} = \frac{1}{x_0 - 1}$$

This equation is transcendental and does not have a closed-form solution. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution. Using a numerical solver, we find that there is no real solution for $x_0$.

Final answer for (2): There is no point that is the nearest point of $M(1,0)$ on $f(x) = e^x$, and the line $MP$ is perpendicular to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at point $P$.

(3) Suppose $f(x)$ has a derivative, and $g(x)$ is always positive on the domain $\mathbb{R}$. Let points $M_1(t-1, f(t)-g(t))$, $M_2(t+1, f(t)+g(t))$. If for any $t \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a point $P$ that is the nearest point of both $M_1$ and $M_2$, we want to determine the monotonicity of $f(x)$.

Let's find the equations of the lines $M_1P$ and $M_2P$. The slope of $M_1P$ is:

$$m_1 = \frac{f(t) - g(t) - f(x)}{t - 1 - x}$$

The slope of $M_2P$ is:

$$m_2 = \frac{f(t) + g(t) - f(x)}{t + 1 - x}$$

Since $P$ is the nearest point to both $M_1$ and $M_2$, the product of the slopes of $M_1P$ and $M_2P$ must be -1:

$$m_1 \cdot m_2 = \frac{f(t) - g(t) - f(x)}{t - 1 - x} \cdot \frac{f(t) + g(t) - f(x)}{t + 1 - x} = -1$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$(f(t) - f(x))^2 - (g(t))^2 = (t - x)^2$$

Now, let's take the derivative of both sides with respect to $t$:

$$2(f(t) - f(x))f'(t) - 2g(t)g'(t) = 2(t - x)$$

Since this equation holds for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we can divide both sides by 2:

$$(f(t) - f(x))f'(t) - g(t)g'(t) = t - x$$

Now, let's consider the cases when $t > x$ and $t < x$.

Case 1: $t > x$

In this case, the left side of the equation is positive, since $f'(t)$ is positive (because $f(x)$ is increasing) and $g(t)$ is positive. Therefore, the right side of the equation must also be positive, which means $t > x$. This implies that $f(x)$ is increasing.

Case 2: $t < x$

In this case, the left side of the equation is negative, since $f'(t)$ is positive and $g(t)$ is positive. Therefore, the right side of the equation must also be negative, which means $t < x$. This implies that $f(x)$ is decreasing.

Since $f(x)$ is both increasing and decreasing for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, it must be constant.

Final answer for (3): The function $f(x)$ is constant.
